<div id="pu0" class="pu"><h1>1970 – Pascal</h1>
<p>The programming language Pascal is named in honor of the French mathematician <a href="https://www.Britannica.com/biography/Blaise-Pascal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Blaise Pascal</a> (1623 – 1662).
It is an imperative programming language developed by <a href="https://people.inf.ETHZ.ch/wirth/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Niklaus Wirth</a> at the ETH Zürich, a technical university in Switzerland.</p>
<p>At its surface Pascal has been designed to be a programming language suitable <a href="https://www.Britannica.com/technology/Pascal-computer-language" rel="nofollow noreferrer">for teaching programming</a> to students (e. g. heavy use of <em>natural</em> language keywords).
Accounting for the limited computing resources in the era of development, another design consideration is suitability for a single-pass translator.
For instance all identifiers need to be declared beforehand.</p>
<p>There were many implementations, e. g. UCSD Pascal (UCSD stands for University of California, San Diego).
With <a href="/a/48936/94076">Turbo Pascal</a> of the company Borland, a dialect of Pascal gained a significant and lasting user base <em>outside</em> of education.</p>
<p>To counter the mess dialects caused, in 1990 Pascal was standardized by the ISO standard 7185 <em>Standard Pascal</em> and ISO standard 10206 <em>Extended Pascal</em> (in addition to almost equivalent standards of some national standardization authorities), making it one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_languages_with_an_ISO_standard" rel="nofollow noreferrer">few programming languages with an ISO standard</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2022, Pascal lives on in the commercial <a href="https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Category:Delphi_Language_Guide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Delphi compiler</a>, a successor of Turbo Pascal, and <a href="https://www.FreePascal.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FreePascal Compiler</a>.</p>

  (Revised Report) published in July 1973. There it says:
  
  “The two textfiles input and output are understood to be predefined
  as parameters and must not be listed explicitly.”

  In Pascal as defined by the ISO standards 7185 and 10206
  this implicit assumption is not the case. }

      Some implementations may experience difficulties with `set of integer`.
      For those implementations you may need to restrict/redefine `integer`:

          The `readLn` discards input until/including an end-of-line marker.
          Thus it is legal to type: 7 Hello World! &lt;enter&gt; }

<div id="pu6" class="pu"><h1>1972 - MUSL</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/history/mu5/" rel="noreferrer">In 1972 Manchester University first commissioned their MU5 computer system</a>. The operating system for that computer was called MUSS (Manchester University Software System) and the language MUSL (Manchester University Systems Language) was created to implement that software.</p>
<p>The MUSL language inherited features from Atlas Autocode, Algol 68, Pascal, BCPL and was specifically designed for the implementation of portable operating systems. It was interesting to note that this development took place at the same time as <strong>C</strong> was being developed for unix. The MUSL compiler was developed using a parser generator called SYNTAB, used an intermediate code generator called MUTL (Manchester University Target Language) and a portable virtual machine code called MUBL (Manchester University Binary Language). MUTL was basically a JIT compiler as we would see it today. Several language compilers targeted MUTL including Fortran, Cobol, Algol, Pascal and so on.</p>
<p>The MUSL compiler was interesting to work with as it only had about 8 error messages. It just flagged &quot;Lexical&quot;, &quot;Syntax&quot;, &quot;Semantics&quot;, &quot;Type&quot; and left it to the programmer to work out where the fault lay!</p>
<p>Although MUSL programs could be written in the normal source form, they were generally expressed in a tool called FLOCODER which graphically represented the code and permitted more than one concrete representation of the algorithm to enable implementation in multiple languages or on multiple platforms from the same file, including embedded documentation. The example MUSL programs are therefore expressed in both the orthodox manner as a code listing and also illustrated in FLOCODER formats, which is how they would have been prepared.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://robs-old-computers.com/projects/mu5/" rel="noreferrer">MU5 emulators being developed</a> which <a href="https://robs-old-computers.com/2018/05/03/muss-source-code/" rel="noreferrer">may eventually run a MUSS system</a>, but at present the code cannot be executed. MUSS (and hence MUSL) was not just implemented on the MU5 but was available on PDP11, VAX, ICL1900, Computervision CDS-4000 CAD/CAM system, MC68000 and several others besides. There may be one of these still running in a museum somewhere!</p>

<div id="pu7" class="pu"><h1>1985 - Dr. LOGO</h1>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hhhgr.png" alt="Dr. LOGO splash-screen"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Digital Research</a> (DR) aimed to make programming accessible to children and one of its releases was Dr. LOGO for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Amstrad CPC</a> range of home computers. In 1986 this became the third programming language I learnt, at the ripe old age of 10, the first two being CreatiVision BASIC on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTech_CreatiVision" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dick Smith Wizzard</a> in 1982 when I was 6, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive_BASIC" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Locomotive BASIC</a> also on the Amstrad in 1986. BASIC (or variants thereof) is still very widely used, so I have chosen Dr. LOGO because it is the first language I learnt that <em>wasn't</em> a version of BASIC! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LOGO</a> (originally developed in 1967) became famous for its use of turtle graphics, however, here I will be demonstrating that it is capable of far more than just that! I have no idea if these procedures would work on the original version of LOGO. I can only confirm that they work on the 1985 version of Dr. LOGO for the Amstrad.</p>

<p>The procedures:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAcgF.png" alt="Screen shot of LOGO procedures"></p>

<pre><code>to year
pr "Dr.\ LOGO\ was\ made\ in\ 1985!
end
to N :n
(local "count "item "line)
make "count 1
repeat :n [make "line " make "item 1 repeat :n [make "line lput (if or or :item = 1 :item = :n :item = :count ["N] ["\ ]) :line make "item :item + 1] pr :line make "count :count + 1]
end
to gcdr :x :y
op if :x = 0 [:y] [gcdr remainder :y :x :x]
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<pre><code>to year
pr "Dr.\ LOGO\ was\ made\ in\ 1985!
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>to</code> starts the procedure, with the name of the procedure following it. <code>pr</code> simply means <strong>pr</strong>int. String literals are terminated by a space or certain other special characters, requiring a backslash before each printing space. <code>end</code> completes the procedure.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFWr0.png" alt="Task 1 output"></p>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<pre><code>to N :n
(local "count "item "line)
make "count 1
repeat :n [
  make "line "
  make "item 1
  repeat :n [
    make "line lput (
      if or or :item = 1 :item = :n :item = :count
        ["N]
        ["\ ]
    ) :line
    make "item :item + 1
  ]
  pr :line
  make "count :count + 1
]
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>:n</code> in the procedure declaration means that it takes a parameter as input and stores it in <code>n</code>. <code>local</code> makes the following variables locally available only, so as not to pollute the global name space. The parentheses are required to stop <code>local</code> from trying to include the next primitive as part of its input. Dr. LOGO has no equivalent of a <code>while</code> loop, only a very simple version of <code>for</code> called <code>repeat</code> which repeats a fixed number of times. <code>:n</code> is used to get the value of the variable named <code>n</code>. <code>repeat</code> cannot contain newlines, so the indentation is for ease of reading only. <code>make</code> <code>"line</code> <code>"</code> stores an empty string in <code>line</code>. <code>lput</code> stands for <strong>l</strong>ast <strong>put</strong>, returning the first parameter appended to the second. The parentheses are not required around the <code>if</code> statement, they simply increase readability. The <code>or</code>s have been nested with the second <code>or</code> taking the first two parameters and the first <code>or</code> taking the result of the second <code>or</code> and the third parameter. If the expression is true, it returns <code>N</code>, if false, it returns <code></code>, which is then appended to <code>line</code> via <code>lput</code>. As is common with most early languages, there is no increment operator, so I have to simply add <code>1</code> to the variable. After the inner loop has completed, it <strong>pr</strong>ints the contents of <code>line</code> and automatically appends a newline.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vc7vo.png" alt="Task 2 output"></p>

<p>As a bonus, it can also output even sized patterns!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DWKDU.png" alt="Task 2 bonus output"></p>

<h1>Task 3</h1>

<pre><code>to gcdr :x :y
op if :x = 0 [:y] [gcdr remainder :y :x :x]
end
</code></pre>

<p>My original procedure was called <code>gcd</code>, but it wasn't recursive, so I wrote a new one, which is why there is an <code>r</code> in the name. This procedure takes two parameters, <code>:x</code> and <code>:y</code>. <code>op</code> is to <strong>o</strong>ut<strong>p</strong>ut the result, the equivalent of <code>return</code> in a lot of modern languages. It very simply checks to see if <code>x</code> is zero, and if it is, the answer must be <code>y</code>. If not, it calculates the <code>remainder</code> (modulus) of <code>y</code> divided by <code>x</code>, which it passes as the first parameter of the recursive function and <code>x</code> (which we know to be non-zero) as the second parameter. Dr. LOGO automatically prints the output when it returns to the prompt.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mXLvH.png" alt="Task 3 output"></p>

<p>I hope you had as much fun looking at the procedures and screen-shots as I did completing this challenge! It was a nostalgic trip down memory lane for me. A combination of RAM and ROM, it's more volatile than I hoped but I'm glad the bus still goes there!</p>

<div id="pu8" class="pu"><h1>1988 - <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mathematica</a></h1>

<p>Or should I call it <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/language/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wolfram Language</a>?</p>

<h2>Task 0</h2>

<p>The creator of Mathematica is Stephen Wolfram, the Founder and CEO of Wolfram Research. Before the development of Mathematica, he was a physicist. There was a huge amount of algebraic calculation in physics, so he became a user of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Macsyma</a>.</p>

<p>Wolfram got his PHD in 1979, when he was 20. He thought that he needed a better CAS than Macsyma to do physics, so he began to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_Manipulation_Program" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SMP</a> (the "Symbolic Manipulation Program"). The first version of SMP was released in 1981. SMP was the predecessor of Mathematica. Though it had a deep influence on Mathematica, none of its code was ever used for Mathematica. </p>

<p>In 1986, Wolfram decided to write an "ultimate computation system". He started writing the code in 1986, and founded the Wolfram Research in 1987. Finally, Mathematica 1.0 was released on June 23, 1988. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uvm2l.png" alt="Mathematica 1.0"></p>

<p>I didn't find Mathematica 1.0. In fact, Mathematica 1.0 had neither a Windows nor a Linux version. But I found Mathematica 2.0 on a Chinese website. It can still be run on Windows XP.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sypJm.png" alt="Mathematica 2.0"></p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<pre><code>Print["Mathematica was made in 1988!"]
</code></pre>

<p>Or simply:</p>

<pre><code>"Mathematica was made in 1988!"
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<p>In today's Mathematica, we can write:</p>

<pre><code>asciiArtN[n_] := Print @@@ SparseArray[{i_, 1 | i_ | n} -&gt; "N", {n, n}, " "]
</code></pre>

<p>Just like <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/48476/programming-languages-through-the-years/48491#48491">Julia</a> and <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/48476/programming-languages-through-the-years/48845#48845">R</a>, this is a matrix solution. In Mathematica, you can define a sparse matrix using pattern matching.</p>

<p>However, <code>SparseArray</code> was introduced in Mathematica 5.0, so we can't use it in Mathematica 1.0.</p>

<p>Here is a solution that works in Mathematica 1.0:</p>

<pre><code>asciiArtN[n_] := Block[{f},
  f[i_, 1]  = "N";
  f[i_, i_] = "N";
  f[i_, n]  = "N";
  f[__]     = " ";
  Apply[Print, Array[f, {n, n}], 1];
]
</code></pre>

<p>We can't write <code>f[i_, 1 | i_ | n]  = "N"</code> because <code>Alternatives</code> was introduced in Mathematica 2.0.</p>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p>We can just use the built-in function:</p>

<pre><code>gcd = GCD
</code></pre>

<p>Or we can use the definition of the GCD:</p>

<pre><code>gcd = Max[Intersection @@ Divisors[{##}]] &amp;;
</code></pre>

<p>Or we can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LCM</a>, though more commonly LCM is computed from GCD:</p>

<pre><code>gcd = Times[##]/LCM[##] &amp;;
</code></pre>

<p>Or we can use the Euclidean algorithm with pattern matching:</p>

<pre><code>gcd[a_, 0] := a
gcd[a_, b_] := gcd[b, Mod[a, b]]
</code></pre>

<p>Or as an anonymous function:</p>

<pre><code>gcd = If[#2 == 0, #1, #0[#2, Mod[##]]] &amp;;
</code></pre>

<p>All the functions above were introduced in Mathematica 1.0. </p>

<div id="pu9" class="pu"><h1>1964 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_BASIC" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dartmouth BASIC</a></h1>

<p><strong>BASIC</strong> is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.</p>

<p>I'm looking at this <a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~dave/basic.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">manual</a> on BASIC from 1964, and this <a href="http://mcgeachie.net:51964/DTSS" rel="nofollow noreferrer">emulator</a> of the Darthmouth Time Sharing System it ran on. The server is still up, but sadly, registering an account seems to be impossible. For now, these programs should theoretically work:</p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<pre><code>10 PRINT "BASIC WAS MADE IN 1964"
20 END
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<pre><code>10 READ N
15 FOR Y = 1 TO N STEP 1
20 FOR X = 1 TO N STEP 1
25 IF X = 1 THEN 50
30 IF X = N THEN 50
35 IF X = Y THEN 50
40 PRINT " ",
45 GO TO 55
50 PRINT "N",
55 NEXT X
60 PRINT
65 NEXT Y
70 DATA 5
75 END
</code></pre>

<p>Outputting something like:</p>

<pre><code>N                       N
N     N                 N
N           N           N
N                 N     N
N                       N
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the input is typed in as part of the program (<code>70 DATA 5</code>); the <code>READ</code> instruction way at the top fetches data from there. There is no string concatenation, but section 3.1 of the manual describes how <code>PRINT</code> results are written to tabulated "zones" on the output.</p>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p>The slow version of Euclid's algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>10 READ A, B
20 IF A = B THEN 80
30 IF A &lt; B THEN 60
40 LET A = A - B
50 GO TO 20
60 LET B = B - A
70 GO TO 20
80 PRINT A
85 DATA 144, 250
90 END
</code></pre>

<p>Outputting:</p>

<div id="pu10" class="pu"><h1>1985 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC" rel="noreferrer">QuickBASIC</a></h1>
<p>QuickBASIC is essentially the same thing as its later version QBasic, albeit with a few features that QBasic doesn't have (such as a compiler). It was part of a second generation of BASIC versions that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#Structured_BASIC" rel="noreferrer">moved more toward structured programming</a>--eliminating the requirement for line numbers, tending toward using loops rather than gotos (though not exclusively), and allowing procedural abstraction via &quot;subprograms.&quot;</p>
<p>(Wikipedia gave vague and possibly conflicting information on what control structures were available in the first version of QuickBASIC, and Google wasn't particularly helpful either; so if you see something that you know shouldn't be in here, let me know and I'll change it.)</p>
<h3>Task 1</h3>
<pre><code>CLS
PRINT &quot;QuickBASIC was made in 1985!&quot;
END
</code></pre>
<p>In QBasic for DOS, at least, the <code>CLS</code> command is needed to clear the screen between successive invocations--otherwise, you'll just keep adding a new <code>QuickBASIC was made in 1985!</code> line each time you run the program.</p>
<h3>Task 2</h3>
<pre><code>CLS
INPUT &quot;Enter size of N: &quot;, size
FOR i = 1 TO size
   FOR j = 1 TO size
      IF j = 1 OR j = i OR j = size THEN PRINT &quot;N&quot;; ELSE PRINT &quot; &quot;;
   NEXT j
   PRINT
NEXT i
END
</code></pre>
<p>The variables here don't have any type indicators and so are numeric by default. If you try to give the <code>INPUT</code> statement something non-numeric, it will print an error message and ask you again. Semicolon isn't a statement separator, it suppresses newline at the end of the <code>PRINT</code> statement.</p>
<h3>Task 3</h3>
<pre><code>CLS
INPUT &quot;Enter two integers: &quot;, a, b
WHILE a &gt; 0
  LET tmp = b
  LET b = a
  LET a = tmp MOD a
WEND
PRINT &quot;GCD is&quot;; b
END
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>INPUT</code> statement with multiple variables accepts two comma-separated numbers. The name of the <code>WEND</code> keyword probably derives from While-END, but the association with <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wend#Verb" rel="noreferrer">wend</a> gives it a nice poetic touch.</p>

<div id="pu13" class="pu"><h1>1962 - SNOBOL</h1>

<p>The "StriNg Oriented and symBOlic Language". At first apparently called the Symbolic Expression Interpreter, 'SEXI', which then had to be changed to prevent the 1960-s era nerds from blushing when submitting their jobs. <a href="http://www.listbox.com/member/archive/247/2008/12/sort/time_rev/page/1/entry/0:180/20081226091150:1B4F85B0-D357-11DD-ABF7-AB09AB975BFC/" rel="noreferrer">True story.</a> </p>

<p>This was one of the first languages that could deal with strings and patterns natively. Indeed, the first version of SNOBOL had the string as its <em>only</em> datatype. Math was then done by parsing. The initial implementation was done on the IBM 7090. It seems to be long gone, at least, I couldn't find it. What I did find was <a href="http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=39602638771518326328" rel="noreferrer">the original paper describing it</a> as well as a <a href="http://www.snobol4.org/dennis.heimbigner/s3/" rel="noreferrer">SNOBOL3 interpreter in Java, which can run on a modern computer</a>.</p>

<p>The first SNOBOL had pretty much <em>only</em> pattern matching and basic arithmetic. SNOBOL 3 then added functions and changed the I/O, but otherwise seems to have remained backwards compatible. SNOBOL 4 changed the syntax, and from there it developed into <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/48476/programming-languages-through-the-years/49088#49088">Icon</a>, which keeps the pattern matching but almost looks like a "normal" programming language otherwise.</p>

<p>The programs I have written use only functionality described in the original paper, so should work with the original SNOBOL with the exception of the I/O, which I did in SNOBOL3 style so that the Java interpreter could run them. From the paper, it seems that the difference is that SNOBOL1 uses pattern matching with a special <code>SYS</code> variable, whereas SNOBOL3 uses input and output variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>Input:

<ul>
<li>1 <code>SYS .READ *DATA*</code></li>
<li>3 <code>DATA = SYSPPT</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Output:

<ul>
<li>1 <code>SYS .PRINT 'A STRING' AND VARIABLES</code></li>
<li>3 <code>SYSPOT = 'A STRING' AND VARIABLES</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Making these substitutions should get you 'real' SNOBOL 1. Of course, then you can't run it. </p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<pre><code>START   SYSPOT = 'SNOBOL WAS MADE IN 1962!'
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<p>This shows math, string handling and flow control. SNOBOL3 has useful functions, like <code>EQ</code> to check equality; the original SNOBOL did not, so I haven't used them.</p>

<pre><code>* READ N FROM INPUT
START   SYSPOT = 'SIZE?'
        SZ = SYSPPT

* INITIALIZE
        CS = ''
        ROW = '0'

* OUTPUT PREVIOUS ROW AND START NEXT ONE
ROW     COL = '0'
        SYSPOT = CS
        CS = ''

COL     SUCC = 'N'
        EQ1 = COL
        FAIL = 'CHKE'
        EQ2 = '0'         /(EQUAL)
CHKE    FAIL = 'CHKR'
        EQ2 = SZ - '1'    /(EQUAL)
CHKR    FAIL = 'SPACE'
        EQ2 = ROW         /(EQUAL)

* CONCATENATE THE RIGHT CHARACTER TO THE CURRENT LINE         
SPACE   CS = CS ' '       /(NEXT)
N       CS = CS 'N'       /(NEXT)

* FOR NUMBERS, SUBSTRING MATCH IS ENOUGH IF IT IS KNOWN A&lt;=B
NEXT    COL = COL + '1'
        COL SZ            /F(COL)
        ROW = ROW + '1'
        ROW SZ            /F(ROW)S(FIN)

* THERE SEEMS TO BE NO EQUALITY CHECK, JUST SUBSTRING MATCHING
* OF COURSE, EQ1 == EQ2 IFF EQ1 CONTAINS EQ2 AND VICE VERSA
* THIS ALSO ILLUSTRATES INDIRECTION
EQUAL   EQ1 EQ2           /F($FAIL)
        EQ2 EQ1           /S($SUCC)F($FAIL)

* OUTPUT THE LAST LINE
FIN     SYSPOT = CS     
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p>First, the boring one. The only thing of note is the smaller-than check, showing exactly how string-oriented SNOBOL really was: <code>(B - A) '-'</code> means "does the result of B-A contain a minus?". SNOBOL3 can also do <code>LE(B,A)</code>, but SNOBOL 1 could not (at least the paper doesn't mention it).</p>

<pre><code>* READ A AND B
START   SYSPOT = 'A?'
        A = SYSPPT
        SYSPOT = 'B?'
        B = SYSPPT

* GCD LOOP
STEP    '0' (A - B)          /S(DONE)
        (B - A) '-'          /S(AB)F(BA)
AB      A = A - B            /(STEP)
BA      B = B - A            /(STEP)
DONE    SYSPOT = 'GCD: ' A
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, when you have a language based entirely around strings and pattern matching, it would be a shame not to actually get to use the pattern matching and replacement. Thus, here is one of those unary-based GCDs, including routines for converting to and from unary. </p>

<pre><code>* READ A AND B
START   SYSPOT = 'A?'
        A = SYSPPT
        SYSPOT = 'B?'
        B = SYSPPT

ADONE   A = UNA.R

        C = B

<div id="pu15" class="pu"><h1>1963 - <a href="http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/2/134.full.pdf+html">CPL</a></h1>

<p>CPL was a language developed jointly between Cambridge and London Universities as an alternative to Algol 60. The CPL can be considered <em>Combined Programming Language</em>, <em>Cambridge Programming Language</em> or <em>Cambridge Plus London</em> depending on your perspective. It may be possible to, in time, to execute the programs on an original working compiler via the Atlas Emulators being developed, but I suspect not.</p>

<p>CPL is significant because it led to the development of the more efficient BCPL at Cambridge and hence to <strong>C</strong>.</p>

<p>The main references sources for the language are the <a href="http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/2/134.full.pdf+html">Computer Journal Article from 1963</a>, the <a href="http://progopedia.com/language/cpl/">entry in Progopedia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPL_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a>. </p>

<p>You may find my notation slightly different to that in the examples in Propedia and Wikipedia. I've adhered more carefully to that described in 1963 and I think some of the other examples may be incorrect or a result of changes made during compiler implementation.</p>

<div id="pu18" class="pu"><h1>1968 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68" rel="noreferrer">Algol 68</a></h1>

<p>Algol 68 was defined by the IFIP Working Group 2.1 as a successor to Algol 60.</p>

<p>It is an expression oriented language in which everything has a value. It is also orthogonal, in which you can use any construct in any way. This means that expressions can be on the RHS and the LHS of an assignment, for example.</p>

<p>All control structures have an abbreviated form as well as a long form using expressions. It also permits the definitions of operators.</p>

<p>The goals of the language are cited as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main aims and principles of design of ALGOL 68:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Completeness and clarity of description</li>
  <li>Orthogonal design,</li>
  <li>Security,</li>
  <li>Efficiency</li>
  <li>Static mode checking</li>
  <li>Mode-independent parsing</li>
  <li>Independent compilation</li>
  <li>Loop optimization</li>
  <li>Representations - in minimal &amp; larger character sets</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>These programs have been tested with the <a href="http://jmvdveer.home.xs4all.nl/" rel="noreferrer">Algol 68 Genie interpreter</a>, which is a complete implementation of the language.</p>

<p>Some features that modern programmers may find different, is that empty statements are not permitted. You cannot just add <code>;</code> everywhere. You have to use the <code>SKIP</code> statement if you want to explicitly have nothing. It also permitted the coding of concurrent programs very easily. Algol 68 also, notably, used backwards keywords as terminators, such as <strong>esac</strong>, <strong>od</strong>, <strong>fi</strong> etc.</p>

<p>The language had a representation used for writing the code that used many fonts  representing keywords  in <strong>bold</strong>, and identifiers in <em>italic</em>, for example. At the time, and probably still, no compiler implemented this feature of the design. The language permitted several different concrete representations of programs using <strong>stropping modes</strong>. This allowed programs to be prepared using limited character sets, such as might be found in computers in the 1960s. Consider the a short program fragment, which would be represented as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>if</strong> <em>i</em> <strong>&lt;</strong> <em>0</em> <strong>then</strong> <strong>skip</strong> <strong>fi</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be prepared for a compiler in <em>prime</em> stropping mode as:</p>

<pre><code>'IF' I 'LT' 0 'THEN' 'SKIP' 'FI'
</code></pre>

<p>In <em>dot</em> stropping mode this would be:</p>

<pre><code>.IF I .LT 0 .THEN .SKIP .FI
</code></pre>

<p>In <em>case</em> stropping mode this would be:</p>

<pre><code>IF i &lt; 0 THEN SKIP FI
</code></pre>

<p>I have great fondness for this language as I worked on one of the compiler implementations, as well as programming in it exclusively for many years.</p>

<h1>Task 1</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>print</em> (("Algol 68 was made in 1968!", <em>newline</em>))</p>

<p>The point to note here is the double parentheses. This is because <em>print</em> is a function that takes a single argument which is a variable length array of the union of all types. The inner parenthesis are the array constructor. This is how polymorphism is handled in this strongly typed language.</p>

<div id="pu19" class="pu"><h1>1967 - APL</h1>

<p>In 1957, at Harvard University, Ken Iverson started developing a 
mathematical notation for array manipulation. During the 1960s,
his notation was developed into a programming language at IBM.
The first partial implementation was created in 1963, and it
was even used in a high school to teach students about transcendental
functions. A full, usable implementation had to wait until
1965. For two years it was only used internally by IBM. In 1967,
IBM released to the public an APL interpreter that ran on
the IBM 1130 computer, which had been finished in 1966. You can understand how it's a bit hard to choose a year for it, however, I think it should be 1967, as this is the first year a full implementation was made available to the public. If anyone really disagrees, I could change it. </p>

<p>The source code for APL\360, is
<a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/the-apl-programming-language-source-code">online</a>, 
as is an emulator. This is what I have used to test these examples.
It dates from 1967, and along with APL\1130 (for the aforementioned
IBM 1130) it is more or less the true original. As expected, it is very
primitive. It lacks support for such niceties as lowercase letters,
any operators <em>only</em> work with builtin functions, and the set of builtin
functions is very sparse (in particular, <code>∨</code> is <em>only</em> <code>or</code>, and does
<em>not</em> double as <code>gcd</code>). The original, full description is available
<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL360TerminalSystem.htm">here</a>,
however, I noticed that the version I had is not even complete with respect to that document, lacking <code>⍎</code> among others.</p>

<p>I have provided the programs both in Unicode format
(so you can read them), and in the original encoding
(so you can cut and paste them into the emulator's APL window).</p>

<p>Unbelievably, these programs run correctly without any changes
(except for the encoding) 
 in modern
versions of Dyalog, NARS2000, and GNU APL. So I guess I've found the way to write portable APL: just pretend it's 1967!</p>

<p>B is the language developed at Bell Labs by Thompson and Ritchie for the  Unix operating system project. It is the original curly-brace language, and one of the first to include a notion that programs should be portable from system to system. Many of the original Unix utilities (such as dc) were first written in B as well. B eventually transitioned smoothly into C (you'll notice that the language in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/49417/8992">marinus's answer</a> is much closer to B than it is to modern C), but the language we see at the start of the process is clearly a different one, lacking support for types, global declarations, <code>for</code> loops, and many other basic C features.</p>
<p><sub>examples run with <a href="https://github.com/Leushenko/ybc" rel="noreferrer">this compiler</a></sub></p>
<h2>Task 1</h2>
<pre><code>main() {
  puts(&quot;B was made in 1969!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, there was no C standard library to link against in 1969, so really we need to define a string printing function too:</p>
<pre><code>main() {
  printstring(&quot;B was made in 1969!&quot;);
}

printstring(s) {
  extrn terminator;
  auto c, i;
  i = 0;
  while((c = char(s, i++)) != terminator) putchar(c);
  putchar('*n');
}

terminator '*0';
</code></pre>
<p><code>putchar</code> was present in B's standard library from the beginning. Notice that special character codes are escaped with <code>*</code>, not with <code>\</code> as they would be in C. (The string terminator was <code>'*e'</code> - 0x03 - on the original system, but that won't work with a modern system, so we're using <code>'*0'</code>.) Indexing a string is done with the built-in <code>char</code> function, because B was designed with the expectation that pointers indexed whole 36-bit words, and characters (four to a word) would have to be extracted manually.</p>
<p>Notice also that the order we define functions and variables doesn't matter. Unlike C, B simply doesn't have a notion of a global scope: if you want to use a name as a variable, you need to declare it manually <em>within</em> your function with <code>extrn</code>. Undeclared names are just assumed to be valid functions.</p>
<p>Interestingly it seems (?) that with the lack of floats or structs, the otherwise-unused <code>.</code> character was a valid &quot;letter&quot; and could be used in variable names. So we could probably have called the function <code>string.print</code> to help with project organization.</p>
<h2>Task 2</h2>
<pre><code>N(size) {
  auto x, y;
  y = size;
  while (y) {
    x = size;
    while (x) {
      if (x == y | x == 1 | x == size) putchar('N'); else putchar(' ');
      x--;
    }
    putchar('*n');
    y--;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>B doesn't support the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> operators, but depending on the version, it <em>might</em> detect that <code>&amp;</code> or <code>|</code> are used inside a conditional statement and short-circuit them anyway.</p>
<p>Local variables couldn't be initialized on creation, but required a separate statement. (The optional syntax <code>auto x 10</code> actually declared x to be an array, not to initialize it with a value.)</p>
<h2>Task 3</h2>
<pre><code>gcd(a, b) {
  return (b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b));
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is where B really shone: it was designed from the outset to support recursive evaluation, making mathematical expressions very easy to write compared to some languages of the time (recursion wasn't universal yet; Fortran wouldn't get it for a while). The ternary operator also helped with this, and was present from the start.</p>
<p>Notice that <code>return</code> requires the value to be parenthesized, like in the bc language.</p>

<div id="pu21" class="pu"><h1>2005 - <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Prelude" rel="noreferrer">Prelude</a></h1>
<p>Prelude is a very fun language, whose source code consists of several &quot;voices&quot; which are executed in parallel and which <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/47112/8478">I <em>really</em> enjoy solving problems in</a>. It is meant to be the ASCII representation of its sister language <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fugue" rel="noreferrer">Fugue</a>, which actually takes .midi files as its source code and encodes the instructions found in Prelude as intervals in the melodies of the voices.</p>
<p>Prelude is fairly minimalistic, yet Turing complete (provided you are using at least 2 voices). As I said, the voices (lines of code) are executed simultaneously, column by column. Each voice operates on its own stack, which is initialised to an infinite number of zeroes. Prelude supports the following instructions:</p>
<pre><code>0-9 ... Push the corresponding digit.
+   ... Add the top two numbers on the stack.
-   ... Subtract the top number from the one beneath.
#   ... Discard the top of the stack.
^   ... Copy the top value from the voice above.
v   ... Copy the top value from the voice below.
?   ... Read a number and push it onto the stack.
!   ... Print the top number (and pop it from the stack).
(   ... If the top of the stack is zero, jump past the matching ')'.
)   ... If the top of the stack is zero, jump to the column after the matching '('.
</code></pre>
<p>Some additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The voices are cyclic, so <code>^</code> on the top voice copies from the bottom voice (and vice versa).</li>
<li>Multiple <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> in the same column are executed top to bottom.</li>
<li>As per <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060504072859/http://z3.ca/%7Elament/prelude.txt" rel="noreferrer">the language specification</a>, <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> read and write characters with the corresponding character code. However, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060504072747/http://z3.ca/%7Elament/prelude.py" rel="noreferrer">the Python interpreter</a> also has a switch in its code to print the numbers themselves instead. For testing purposes I am actually using <a href="https://gist.github.com/mbuettner/5f5688758c7171a6675c" rel="noreferrer">a modified version</a> which can also <em>read</em> numbers instead of characters. But <a href="https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4719/8478">consensus around here is</a> that numerical input/output can actually be given as byte values, hence these modifications are not necessary to make valid programs dealing with numbers.</li>
<li>Matching <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> do not need to be on the same voice. The voice used for the condition is <em>always</em> the one where the <code>(</code> appears. Hence, the vertical position of the <code>)</code> is completely irrelevant.</li>
<li>Due to the nature of Prelude's simultaneous execution, any instruction in the same column as a <code>(</code> is executed only once before the loop starts, and regardless of whether the loop is entered. Similarly, any instruction in the same column as a <code>)</code> is executed at the end of each iteration, regardless of whether the loop will be exited after this iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll first show you the three programs without much commenting. You can find extensive explanations below.</p>
<h2>The Programs</h2>
<h3>&quot;Hello, World!&quot; Variant</h3>
<pre><code>9(1-)v98+^++!9v+!  v88++2+!^  ! ^9-3-! v      !    v2-!55+!
8 8+ !     7v+! 1v+!88+^+!^4-!^ v8-^ !!!9v+  !^9+9+!  v5+!
     ^98++4+! ^8-! ^4-   ^ #!^6-!    ^^  #5+! v    ^2-!1+!
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using the Python interpreter, make sure that <code>NUMERIC_OUTPUT = False</code>.</p>
<h3>ASCII Art N</h3>
<pre><code>      v2-(1-)v         
9(1-)?1-( v!  (1-55+!      0     (0)#  ))55+!
4-4+                  v^-#
     v!      v! v1-v!(1- ^(#^!0)# v! )v!
6 8+           v#
</code></pre>
<p>For ease of use, this program benefits from reading input as numbers, but output must not be numeric. So if you are using the modified Python interpreter, set</p>
<pre><code>NUMERIC_INPUT = True
NUMERIC_OUTPUT = False
</code></pre>
<h3>GCD</h3>
<pre><code>?(                         v)
? (^-(0 # v   #       ^+0)#^ !
     ^^ (##v^v+)#  0 (0 )   
      1) ^ #  - 1+(#)#
</code></pre>
<p>This is best used with all numeric input/output i.e.</p>
<pre><code>NUMERIC_INPUT = True
NUMERIC_OUTPUT = True
</code></pre>
<h2>Explanations</h2>
<h3>&quot;Hello, World!&quot; Variant</h3>
<p>This is <em>fairly</em> straight-forward. I'm using 3 voices to successively generate the character codes for all the characters in <code>Prelude was made in 2005!</code>. I start by computing <code>8 + 9*8 = 80</code>, which is the character code of <code>P</code>:</p>
<pre><code> 9(1-)
 8 8+
</code></pre>
<p>After that I mostly just copy the previous character code and add or subtract the difference to the next one. Here is the code, but with each <code>!</code> replaced with the character that is being printed (and <code>_</code> for spaces and <code>%</code> for the digits):</p>
<pre><code>9(1-)v98+^++r9v+u  v88++2+w^  _ ^9-3-a v      _    v2-%55+!
8 8+ P     7v+l 1v+e88+^+_^4-s^ v8-^ de_9v+  n^9+9+%  v5+%
     ^98++4+e ^8-d ^4-   ^ #a^6-m    ^^  #5+i v    ^2-%1+!
</code></pre>
<p>The final <code>55+!</code> prints a trailing newline, just because it's nicer.</p>
<p>As a side note, the number of voices is pretty arbitrary for this task, but 3 is fairly convenient because it's the largest number in which every voice can directly access each other voice.</p>
<h3>ASCII Art N</h3>
<pre><code>      v2-(1-)v         
9(1-)?1-( v!  (1-55+!      0     (0)#  ))55+!
4-4+                  v^-#
     v!      v! v1-v!(1- ^(#^!0)# v! )v!
6 8+           v#
</code></pre>
<p>With 5 voices, this is definitely one of the most complex programs I've written so far. The voices roughly have the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Merely a helper voice which stores <code>N-1</code> for use in the inner loop.</li>
<li>This is sort of the &quot;main&quot; voice, which reads input, contains an important switch and also contains the outer loop (i.e. the one over the rows).</li>
<li>This stores a <code>32</code> to conveniently print spaces.</li>
<li>This contains the inner loop (the one over the columns).</li>
<li>This stores a <code>78</code> to conveniently print <code>N</code>s.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's go through the code part by part. First, I'm creating the <code>32</code> as <code>-4 + 9*4</code> and the <code>78</code> as <code>6 + 9*8</code>:</p>
<pre><code>9(1-)
4-4+

6 8+
</code></pre>
<p>Now I'm printing a single <code>N</code> (because we always need one) while reading the input <code>N</code> and storing <code>N-1</code> and <code>N-2</code> in the first two voices:</p>
<pre><code>      v2-
     ?1-

     v!
</code></pre>
<p>Next, there is a &quot;loop&quot; conditioned on <code>N-1</code>. At the end of the loop, the second voice is always reduced to <code>0</code>, and the loop exits after the first iteration. So essentially, this only <code>if(N &gt; 1){...}</code>. After the loop we print a single trailing newline. To recap, we've now got the following framework:</p>
<pre><code>      v2-
9(1-)?1-(                               )55+!
4-4+
     v!
6 8+
</code></pre>
<p>Inside this conditional, we first <code>N-2</code> spaces and a single <code>N</code> to complete the first row, and we also store <code>N-1</code> on the first voice for future use:</p>
<pre><code>         (1-)v         
          v!  

             v!
</code></pre>
<p>Now the real meat of the code. First, there is an outer loop, which prints <code>N-1</code> rows. For each row, we <em>first</em> print a newline, and an <code>N</code>. Then we loop <code>N-2</code> times, printing either spaces or <code>N</code>s (more on that later). And finally we print another <code>N</code>:</p>
<pre><code>               1-55+!  

                v1-v!(               )v!
               v#
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the fun part: printing each row (and getting the position of the <code>N</code> right). There is not really an if/else in Prelude, so I have to build it myself using two loops on different voices. The condition can easily be obtained by subtracting the inner and outer loop variable - we get <code>0</code> if we want to print <code>N</code> and something non-zero if we want to print a space.</p>
<p>The basic idea of an if/else in Prelude is to put a loop after the relevant value - the &quot;if&quot; (or non-zero) code, and exit it immediately by pushing a <code>0</code>. On another voice, you keep a non-zero value, and another loop <em>after</em> the &quot;if&quot; loop. <em>During</em> the &quot;if&quot; loop you put a zero on top of that other voice, so as to prevent the &quot;else&quot; from being executed. There is some flexibility in whether you push zero values on top of non-zero values or simply discard the non-zero value if there's a zero beneath, but this is the general idea. You might also have to do some cleanup afterwards, if you want to keep using the relevant voice. This is what the code looks like:</p>
<pre><code>                           0     (0)#
                      v^-#
                      1- ^(#^!0)# v! 
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<h3>GCD</h3>
<p>This is &quot;just&quot; an iterative implementation of the Euclidean algorithm. But modulo in Prelude is a bit annoying, mostly because you can't easily check if a number is positive or negative. This code makes use of a <em>signum</em> implementation <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/44415/8478">I wrote a while ago</a>. I.e. a large part of the code just turns a number into <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. This can then easily be turned into a condition for positive or negative numbers by adding or subtracting <code>1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>?(                         v)
? (^-(0 # v   #       ^+0)#^ !
     ^^ (##v^v+)#  0 (0 )   
      1) ^ #  - 1+(#)#
</code></pre>
<p>So we've got four voices this time. The first voice simply keeps track of <code>b</code> and contains the main termination condition (i.e. the loop exits when <code>b</code> becomes <code>0</code>). The second voice contains <code>a</code> and with the help of voices three and four computes <code>a % b</code>, before swapping the result with the previous <code>b</code>. Finally, the <code>!</code> prints <code>a</code> when <code>b == 0</code>.</p>
<p>Let's look at the <em>signum</em> part first:</p>
<pre><code>     (0 # v   #
     ^^ (##v^v+)#
      1) ^ #  -
</code></pre>
<p>The input number <code>n</code> is found on the first of those voices (the second voice in the full program). The result will end up on the bottom voice. The other two voices are expected to be empty (i.e. filled with zeroes). Notice that, if <code>n == 0</code>, then both loops are skipped and the bottom voice still contains <code>0</code>, just what we want.</p>
<p>If <code>n</code> is non-zero, the first small loop is entered. We push a zero to exit it immediately, put two copies of <code>n</code> onto the middle voice and a <code>1</code> onto the bottom voice. Now the basic idea is to increment one of the copies of <code>n</code> while decrementing the other copy of <code>n</code> until one of them hits zero. While doing so, the <code>1</code> on the bottom voice flips its sign all the time (which is easily done by subtracting it from <code>0</code> beneath it on the stack). This is set up such that <em>when</em> one of the numbers hits zero, the bottom voice will contain the correct sign.</p>
<p>Now modulo is implemented by subtracting <code>b</code> from <code>a</code> until the result is negative. When that happens, we add one <code>b</code> again. That's this bit:</p>
<pre><code>  (^-  signum         ^+0)#
       signum      0 (0 )   
       signum   1+(#)#
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the if/else construction at the bottom, which is similar to the one I used for Task 2.</p>

<p><a href="http://ideone.com/FD3Mig"><strong>Try it here</strong></a></p>

<p>Forth is a relatively easy-to-learn imperative and stack-based programming language. Forth was created by Charles Moore and Elizabeth Rather from a system that had been in development by Charles Moore starting in 1968. They improved and ported Forth to multiple systems over the next decade.</p>

<p>Forth was originally titled "FOURTH", but file names were limited to five characters on the IBM 1130 operating system, so it was named "FORTH".</p>

<p>Forth is written in "reverse Polish notation," which is also known as "postfix" notation. The language is extensible, meaning the user can define their own commands (called "words"), as shown below. Historically, all words would be uppercase, though now this is not a requirement.</p>



<h2>Task 1</h2>

<p>I define a word called <code>year</code> that prints the string. The space after <code>."</code> is required, but will not be printed.</p>

<pre class="lang-forth prettyprint-override"><code>: year ." Forth was made in 1970!" ;
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<p>I define a word called <code>printn</code> that prints the ascii 'N' as required. I also extended the functionality to allow even numbers as well, so that any integer greater than zero can be entered. (It displays nicely only up to about 90 or so using the given link.) Note that the indentation is purely for readability, though it can be typed and run this way as well.</p>

<div id="pu25" class="pu"><h1>1972 - Smalltalk</h1>

<p>A historical programming language question <em>without Smalltalk</em>? Inconceivable!</p>

<p>It's the mother of all OO languages, it's the source of Patterns, Agile, XP, and has influenced (and still influences) languages like Java and many others. The Eclipse IDE was born as a Java-reincarnation of Smalltalk's RefactoringBrowser, for instance, and things like message chaining have made their way to Java as well (though Java is still waiting for proper closures). Although it's become something of a niche language these days, I still love to dabble in it when I get the chance. Debugging in any other language I've seen pales in comparison, and (I know several Java people who hate it when I say this) I don't know of any other language in which one is nearly as productive as in Smalltalk.</p>

<p>Smalltalk is completely OO in the sense that <em>everything is an object</em>. No primitives, even numbers are objects, and even <code>nil</code> is an Object that understands messages. Syntax is, simply, <code>object message</code>, which <em>always</em> returns an object so that another message can be sent to the result. There are only 5 reserved keywords (<code>self</code>, <code>super</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>nil</code>) in most flavours, the rest of the language is written in itself. It is all about elegance and readability, and is strong on conventions for explicit naming, with the goal that code reads almost like English and can be (mostly) understood by anyone without having to know details about the language.</p>

<p>Smalltalk began in 1972, and several flavours of it have developed over the years. Its decline is probably due to a time in which most serious alternatives were all commercial. <a href="http://pharo.org/" rel="noreferrer">Pharo</a> is a newer, open source flavour of Smalltalk (based on Squeak) for anyone who wants to give it a try.</p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<p>The default output in Smalltalk is called the <code>Transcript</code>. Asking it to show some text is very simple.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Transcript show: 'Smalltalk was made in 1972!'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Here, <code>Transcript</code> is the class (also an object, of course), which understands the message <code>#show:</code>. Colons introduce arguments, and the argument we pass is the string we want to show; single quotes convert text to a <code>String</code> instance.</p>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<p><strong>Code</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>| isNBlock oddNumbers |
isNBlock := [:rowIndex :columnIndex :size |

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: The first line declares two local variables (scope here just being the workspace for the sake of testing), which are then defined as a block of code (a closure) that, given three arguments, returns whether or not the character to print should be an <code>N</code>, and some odd numbers, respectively. Then, we simply iterate over the numbers (loop variables are, by convention, prefixed with <code>each</code> to emphasise their iterative nature), and over the rows and columns. For each row and column index, we pass both the indexes and the size to the three-argument block and show the appropriate character in the transcript. The rest is just to make sure we show a <code>Character cr</code>, i.e. a carriage return (yes, sometimes even Smalltalk uses abbreviations, I'm not a fan of them) at the right times.</p>

<p>Selecting the code in the workspace and executing a "do it" from the context menu produces the following output in the transcript:</p>

<pre><code>Output for n=1
N

Output for n=3
N N
NNN
N N

Output for n=5
N   N
NN  N
N N N
N  NN
N   N

Output for n=7
N     N
NN    N
N N   N
N  N  N
N   N N
N    NN
N     N
</code></pre>

<p>A possible improvement would be to have the block return the character instead of a boolean, but I thought it might be clearer this way.</p>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p><strong>Code</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>firstNumber gcd: secondNumber
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: An <code>Integer</code> instance understands the message <code>#gcd:</code> and is able to find the greatest common divisor of itself and the argument. So if you selected the text <code>6132 gcd: 1679</code> (in a workspace, or in any other text area) and selected "print it" from the context menu, it would print <code>73</code>.</p>

<p>Nim (formally &quot;Nimrod&quot;) is a statically typed, imperative programming language.  It is designed as a modern systems programming language, combining runtime efficiency with an expressive syntax.</p>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>No ceremony required here.  We use the <code>echo</code> function from the <code>system</code> module that is automatically imported for all programs to write a message to stdout.</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;Nim was made in 2008!&quot;
</code></pre>
<h1>Ascii Art N</h1>
<p>This program expects a single command-line argument that is the size of the letter <strong>N</strong> to produce.  Nim's expressiveness is demonstrated by the use of list comprehensions to generate the list of values to enumerate over.  <code>stdout.write</code> is used instead of <code>echo</code> so that a newline character is not written to stdout after printing each character.</p>
<pre><code>from os import paramStr
from strutils import parseInt

let size = parseInt(paramStr(1))

for i in 1..size:
  for j in 1..size:
    if j == 1 or j == i or j == size:
      stdout.write 'N'
    else:
      stdout.write ' '
  stdout.write &quot;\n&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The following statement, run from the console, will generate a letter <strong>N</strong> of size 10:</p>
<pre><code>nim c -r ascii_art_n.nim 10
</code></pre>
<h1>GCD</h1>
<p>Not much to say here.  Note the use of the implicit variable <code>result</code> that is used to return a value from the function.</p>
<pre><code>proc gcd(a: int, b: int): int =
  if b == 0:
    result = a
  else:
    result = gcd(b, a mod b)

echo gcd(8, 12)
echo gcd(12, 8)
echo gcd(3, 30)
echo gcd(5689, 2)
echo gcd(234, 876)

<h1>1972 - SQL</h1>
<p>The Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_programming_languages" rel="noreferrer">timeline of languages</a> has this as being 1972, however I can't find any other references to support this.<br />
Given the untimely demise of Raymond Boyce in 1974 and his gaining of a PhD in computer science in 1971, 1972 seems to fit.</p>
<p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is designed for managing data held in a relational database.  It was originally called SEQUEL, but was later changed to SQL because of trademark issues.</p>
<p>It was originally developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_D._Chamberlin" rel="noreferrer">Donald Chamberlain</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_F._Boyce" rel="noreferrer">Raymond Boyce</a> to work with IBMs database management system, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_R" rel="noreferrer">System R.</a></p>
<p>SQL became a ANSI standard in 1986 and since then has gone through a number of revisions.  Even though it is a standard, there are many different variations/implementations of it.  This means that portability of code between different RDBMSs can sometimes be difficult.</p>
<p>SQL is comprised of DML (Data Manipulation Language) and DDL (Data Definition Language).</p>
<p>DML consists of statements like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, etc and is the language used to query, modify, remove the data in the RDBMS.</p>
<p>DDL consists of statements like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc and is the language used to define the data structures in the RDBMS.</p>
<p>While I've used T-SQL to complete the tasks I've tried to complete the tasks with mostly standard SQL.
The queries should also be able to port to other and earlier dialects of SQL relatively easily.</p>
<h2>Task 1</h2>
<p>As a simple query that returns a literal.</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT 'SQL was made in 1972!' AS Greeting
</code></pre>
<p>Another way that demonstrates some basic SQL</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>-- Create a table for the greetings
CREATE TABLE Salutation (
    Type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Greeting VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );

-- Put some rows into the table
INSERT INTO Salutation (Type, Greeting)
VALUES 
    ('ALL','Hello World!')
    ,('MADE','SQL was made in 1972!')
    ,('DIRECT','Nice to meet you!')
    ,('AUSSIE','G''Day Mate!')
    ,('COWBOY','Howdy Partner!')
    ,('GOLFED','Hi!');

-- Select the greeting that we want
SELECT Greeting
FROM Salutation
WHERE Type = 'MADE';
    
</code></pre>
<h2>Task 2</h2>
<p>This query makes use of a Number (or Tally) table to provide a way of doing pseudo loops.
Normally I would use the STUFF function to do the string manipulation, but this isn't that compatible with other dialects.</p>
<p>This does rely on the correct interpretation of NULLs however and the SPACE function returning NULL for negative values.</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>--Create a table of numbers
CREATE TABLE Number (
    N INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
    );
INSERT INTO Number (N)
SELECT TOP 100000  
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) N
FROM master.sys.columns a, master.sys.columns b;

-- Do an ASCII N
-- Oracle being one of the first implementers of SQL would use bind
-- variables, eg :N.  The functions used would also be different
-- For example ISNULL would likely require a DECODE and NVL function. 
DECLARE @N INTEGER = 5 

SELECT
    'N' + ISNULL(SPACE(N-2)+'N','') + ISNULL(SPACE(@N-N-1)+'N','') S
FROM Number
WHERE N &lt;= @N;
    
</code></pre>
<p>Result from the query</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>S
------------
N   N
NN  N
N N N
N  NN
N   N
</code></pre>
<h2>Task 3</h2>
<p>Using the same Number table as created in Task 2.</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>DECLARE @A INTEGER = 284
DECLARE @B INTEGER = 876

-- This query uses a CASE statement.  In earlier versions of Oracle SQL
-- a DECODE function would have been used instead.  The MOD function
-- would be used rather than the % operator
SELECT @A A, @B B, MAX(N)
FROM (
    SELECT N, @A % N AM, @B % N BM
    FROM Number
    WHERE N &lt;= CASE WHEN @A &lt; @B THEN @A ELSE @B END
    ) AS GCD
WHERE AM = 0 AND BM = 0;
</code></pre>
<p>The result of the query is</p>
<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>A           B           GCD

<div id="pu28" class="pu"><h1>1973 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMAL" rel="nofollow">COMAL</a></h1>

<p>Quite a number of COMAL resources can be found on the web. Since I have no prior exposure to COMAL (we are now well past my birth year), I'll quote and <a href="http://archive.org/stream/1984-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_054_1984_Nov#page/n103" rel="nofollow">link</a> some of them here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMAL" rel="nofollow">COMAL</a> (<em>Common Algorithmic
  Language</em>) is a computer programming language developed in Denmark by
  Benedict Løfstedt and Børge R. Christensen in 1973.</p>
  
  <p>COMAL was created as a mixture of the prevalent educational
  programming languages of the time, BASIC, Pascal … The language was
  meant to introduce structured programming elements in an environment
  where BASIC would normally be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.josvisser.nl/opencomal/article.html" rel="nofollow">OpenComal</a>, <a href="http://www.josvisser.nl/opencomal/" rel="nofollow">originally</a> by Jos Visser and <a href="https://github.com/pietsch/OpenCOMAL" rel="nofollow">forked</a> to run on recent Linux systems by Christian Pietsch, to write and test these programs.  Jos defines COMAL as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A crossover between Basic and Pascal, with the best features of both
  and none of the drawbacks of either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenComal comes with nice <a href="https://github.com/pietsch/OpenCOMAL/blob/master/doc/OpenComal.txt" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, which is more than detailed enough to make it easy to write the code.  It also gives some history:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the early history of micro computing, resources … were scarce …
  BASIC was the language of choice back then. Almost all micro computers
  featured their own dialect of BASIC … Most of the time they lacked
  about everything necessary to develop well-structured and maintainable
  programs …</p>
  
  <p>The principles of structured programming were available of course, but
  structured languages like PASCAL were not really available for small
  micro's due to limitations in the micro's resource capacity and the
  then available compiler technology.</p>
  
  <p>Somewhere in Denmark a teacher named Borge Christensen understood the
  potential dangers of the BASIC habits and he [modified] an available
  BASIC interpreter so as to create a new language which should support
  structured programming concepts like PROCedures, FUNCtions and
  GOTO-less loops. The first Comal … interpreter was born.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Task 1</h3>

<pre><code>   10 PRINT "COMAL was made in 1973!"
</code></pre>

<p>Every line has to be numbered, but note that the line numbers are used only for editing — there is no <code>GOTO</code>.  The COMAL executable is an editor and interpreter rolled into one.  You enter the code; <code>list</code> prints it back to you nicely formatted (as the <em>Compute!</em> article linked above would have it: “You type in a BASIC program; when you list it back, it looks as if it has been changed to Pascal”).  The line numbers allow you replace, <code>edit</code>, or <code>delete</code> certain lines.  When you are satisfied, you <code>run</code> the program.  Actually, this way of programming was quite fun — just remember to <code>save</code> often because the interpreter crashes sometimes.</p>

<h3>Task 2</h3>

<p>COMAL uses postfix <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28computer_programming%29" rel="nofollow">sigils</a> to distinguish variable types.  Thus <code>n#</code> is an integer, <code>n$</code> a string, and <code>n</code> a floating point variable.  Booleans are of the <code>1</code>/<code>0</code> variety and indices (for substrings or arrays, though the latter can be changed with <code>DIM</code>) start at <code>1</code>.</p>

<pre><code>   10 INPUT "Enter a number ": n#
   20 
   30 n$:=" N"
   40 
   50 FOR i:=1 TO n# DO
   60   FOR j:=1 TO n# DO
   70     n:=1+(j=1 OR j=i OR j=n#)
   80     PRINT n$(n:n),
   90   ENDFOR j
  100   PRINT 
  110 ENDFOR i
  120 
  130 END
</code></pre>

<h3>Task 3</h3>

<p>Recursion is supported (the file <code>TODO</code> does state ”Heavily recursive Comal programs mess up the interpreter a bit”, but I had no problems with <code>gcd</code>).  <code>FUNC</code>tion and <code>PROC</code>edure names have the same sigils as variables.  A function or procedure may be declared <code>CLOSED</code> meaning that all variables are local (in this case, it does not change anything of course).</p>

<pre><code>   10 INPUT "Enter two numbers ": a#, b#
   20 PRINT gcd#(a#, b#)
   30 
   40 FUNC gcd#(a#, b#) CLOSED
   50   IF b#=0 THEN RETURN a#
   60   RETURN gcd#(b#, a# MOD b#)
   70 ENDFUNC gcd#
</code></pre>

<div id="pu29" class="pu"><h1>1972 - C</h1>



<p>We all know about C, don't we? C was created at Bell Labs, along with
Unix. Unix was largely written in C. All modern Unix derivatives are
still largely written in C. C's syntax has influenced many, many
programming languages. It is probably the oldest programming language
that is still in widespread use for new development.</p>

<p>C itself is a descendant of B, which I hope will end up in this list
as well. There was no 'A' programming language: B is a variant of
BCPL, which in turn is a stripped down CPL. None of these languages were
ever very popular. However, BCPL was the language in which the first
"Hello World" program was written. Another interesting fact is that
B had both <code>/* */</code> and <code>//</code> comments, but C dropped the <code>//</code> comments.
They were later reintroduced into C with the C99 standard.</p>

<p>The C programs here were tested with the Unix V5 C compiler, from
1974. This was the oldest C compiler I could find and get to work, and these programs
will not compile on a modern C compiler. (One of the changes made is
that mutation operators like <code>+=</code> used to be written <code>=+</code>.)</p>

<p><code>#include &lt;</code>...<code>&gt;</code> did not exist yet. Neither did much of the standard library.
I had to write my own <code>atoi</code>. I went through some of the V5 source code
to figure out which things were allowed and which were not. The version I
used was the first to include <code>struct</code>s, but since I did not use those,
and the syntax doesn't seem to have changed a lot until V7 (as K&amp;R C),
this might work with earlier versions as well.</p>

<p>I have done my best to write my code in the same style as the V5
source code uses. (Not that that is terribly consistent, though.)</p>

<p>Look <a href="http://farid.hajji.name/blog/2014/05/05/unix-v5-on-pdp11-using-simh/">here</a>
for links to Unix V5, an emulator, and instructions on getting it running
on a modern computer.</p>

<h3>Language History</h3>

<p>C# was developed by Microsoft for its .NET platform as part of the Common Language Infrastructure. It was later approved as a standard.</p>

<p>Then, in 2015, I posted this answer. Sampriti pointed out that it was made in 2000, not 2001, so I updated the answer.  The edit broke everything. I changed it back to 2001 with Calvin's Hobbies' permission. So, to all reading this: C# was actually made in 2000. (Note that keeping it as 2001 does not give me an advantage in terms of score since the scoring system favors older languages.)</p>

<p>The original Microsoft BASIC interpreter was written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen for the Altair 8800, despite neither of them having access to one.  It was a success, and was subsequently ported to a wide range of early personal computers, providing the programming language that most of a generation of programmers started with.</p>
<p>The programs here were tested on a Commodore 64 emulator (1977), but they should work on nearly any variant of Microsoft BASIC.</p>

<h2>PETSCII Art N</h2>
<p>Nothing too fancy here; just a pair of loops to write out the &quot;N&quot;.  The code will work for any value of N up to about 32767, but the screens of the computers Microsoft BASIC ran on were rarely larger than 40x25, giving a practical limit of 22 (to prevent scrolling when the &quot;READY.&quot; prompt appears after program completion).</p>
<pre><code>1 INPUT N

<h2>GCD</h2>
<p>Microsoft BASIC doesn't have an integer mod function, so I use the subtraction-based variant of Euclid's algorithm.  This also demonstrates the lack of compound control structures and the abundant use of GOTOs that characterized the early dialects of BASIC.</p>

<div id="pu37" class="pu"><h1>2012 -  <a href="https://github.com/PhiNotPi/Element">Element</a></h1>

<p>This is a language that I invented in early 2012 to be a simple golfing language.  By this, I mean that there is very little to no operator overloading.  The operators are also simpler and fewer in number than most modern golfing languages.</p>

<p>The most interesting features of this language are its data structures.  There are <em>two</em> stacks and a hash that are used to store information.</p>

<p>The m-stack is the main stack, where arithmetic and most other operations take place.  When data is inputted or printed, this is where it goes or is retrieved from.</p>

<p>The c-stack is the control stack.  This is where boolean arithmetic takes place.  The top values of the c-stack are used by If and While loops as the condition.</p>

<p>The hash is where variables are stored.  The <code>;</code> and <code>~</code> store and retrieve data from the hash, respectively.</p>

<p>Element is a very weakly typed language. It uses Perl's ability to freely interpret numbers as strings and vice-versa.</p>

<p>While I'm at it, I might as well include all the documentation for the language.  <strong>You can find the <em>original</em> 2012 interpreter, written in Perl, right <a href="http://pastebin.com/rZKMKDWv">here</a>.  Update:  I have created a more usable version, which you can find right <a href="https://github.com/PhiNotPi/Element/blob/master/Interpreter">here</a>.</strong></p>

<pre><code>OP    the operator.  Each operator is a single character
STACK tells what stacks are affected and how many are popped or pushed
      "o" stands for "other effect"
HASH  tells if it involves the hash
x &amp; y represent two values that are already on the stack, so the effect of
      the operator can be more easily described

<div id="pu38" class="pu"><h1>1975 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Scheme</a></h1>
<p>Scheme is one of the older and most successful dialects of the LISP family of languages. It predates Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, and most others still in use.</p>
<p>Its philosophy is based on minimalism and extensibility.</p>
<p>The basic language is made of a minimal set of syntax rules; 12 &quot;fundamental forms,&quot; or keywords that need to be specifically implemented by the runtime, such as <em>if</em> and <em>define</em>; and 11 &quot;library forms,&quot; keywords that are part of the language definition, but can be internally implemented using the fundamendal forms.</p>
<p>The minimalism is coupled with extreme extensibility. Scheme's macro system is arguably the most advanced hygienic, Turing-complete pre-processor of all programming languages. It is to C's macro preprocessor as a Ferrari is to a soap box!</p>
<p>Scheme's unique philosophy and its hacker-friendly minimal footprint have always attracted many thinkers and tinkerers alike. 40 years after its inception we have dozens of implementations, running on all sorts of platforms and using all manner of compiler or interpreter technologies, including very <a href="http://home.pipeline.com/%7Ehbaker1/CheneyMTA.html" rel="noreferrer"><em>bizarre</em></a> but <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/" rel="noreferrer"><em>effective</em></a> ones. Scheme is an excellent testbed for programming language ideas, but it is also a great language for everyday programming.</p>
<p>Its syntax may appear strange to those unfamiliar with LISP, but it has many advantages, starting with its regularity. Every function, operator, and control structure of the language takes the same form: <code>(name arguments...)</code> where both the name and the arguments may be nested expressions. This simplicity and regularity makes Scheme the ideal language for teaching programming to novice students, as demonstrated by the success of <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html" rel="noreferrer"><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em></a> by MIT Press. Citing Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before SICP, the introductory courses were almost always filled with learning the details of some programming language, while SICP focuses on finding general patterns from specific problems and building software tools that embody each pattern.</p>

<h3>Language History</h3>
<p>SAS, previously an acronym for Statistical Analysis System, was developed at North Carolina State University from 1966 to 1976 by Anthony Barr, a professor at NC State, and James Goodnight, a student at NC State. The SAS Institute was incorporated in 1976, when it released the first commercial version of SAS, which was a redesign of the original version developed at NC State.</p>
<p>The language's syntax was based on PL/I, and indeed the internals were originally written in PL/I. However, the internals have since been rewritten in C.</p>
<p>Once the reigning king of commercial statistical software, in recent years interest in SAS has waned, giving way to languages like R and Python. The reasons for this are numerous, including the fact that a single user license for SAS can cost upward of $10,000 USD annually whereas R and Python are free, and SAS is strictly and vehemently closed source while R and Python are open source. However, though it's struggling to remain generally relevant, SAS still maintains a stranglehold on the world of FDA-regulated clinical trials.</p>
<h3>&quot;Hello, World!&quot; Variant</h3>
<pre class="lang-matlab prettyprint-override"><code>%put SAS was made in 1976!;

<h2>Task 1: Hello World!</h2>

<pre><code>'J was made in 1990!'
</code></pre>

<p>This reflects the typical use of J: in an REPL, this would echo the string back at you. Not very useful in general, but exactly what we want here.</p>

<h2>Task 2: ASCII N</h2>

<pre><code>' N' {~ (1) 0 _1}"1 =@i.
</code></pre>

<p>What we do here might be a bit different other languages would do. We start by creating an identy matrix of a given size: <code>=@i.</code>. Then we set the first and last collumn to be 1: <code>(1) 0 _1}"1</code>. (If you were to name everything, one might name it as <code>1 (first, last) set collumns</code>, or something like that). Then, we use these values as indices to the string <code>' N'</code>, 0-indexed, so that we get the wanted result. Again, as this returns a string(matrix), this is printed to screen.</p>

<p>This is an anonymous function, so we could assign it to a variable (or not, but it is convenient), and run it:</p>

<pre><code>    f =: ' N' {~ (1) 0 _1}"1 =@i.
    f 5
N   N
NN  N
N N N
N  NN
N   N
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 3: GCD</h2>

<p>There is just a builtin function for this: <code>+.</code>. However, since this is not fun in the slightest, we are going to define our own function:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;./&amp;.:(_ q: ])
</code></pre>

<p>This also reflects the different attitude that is often used in J, as opposed to Von-Neumann languages. First, we aquire a table of all prime exponents of the entire list of numbers: <code>(_ q: ])</code>. Then, we find the minimum of every collumn: <code>&lt;./</code>. Lastly, <code>&amp;.:</code> applies the inverse of <code>(_ q: ])</code> to the result, which gives the GCD. </p>

<p>PHP began life as a project of Rasmus Lerdorf, intended to help him manage his personal homepage. The original name was Personal Home Page Tools, later changed to Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter (PHP/FI). Lerdorf <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#History" rel="noreferrer">never intended to create a programming language</a>, but things snowballed, a development team was formed, and the rest is history. PHP is now used extensively for server-side scripting as one of the options for the P in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" rel="noreferrer">LAMP</a> (or WAMP); more-recent versions have added support for command-line and client-side GUI applications as well.</p>
<p>Syntax is closest to Perl, with <code>$</code> used for variables and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.conversion" rel="noreferrer">implicit casting between strings and numbers</a>. Like JavaScript, PHP has been criticized for its ad-hoc construction, which resulted in numerous weird quirks and inconsistencies; nevertheless, I find it fairly easy to work with in practice. The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/langref.php" rel="noreferrer">PHP language reference</a> is always helpful.</p>

<p>So Wikipedia was a bit ambiguous on the release date. But this was one of the options.</p>
<p>MATLAB is mathematical language based on numerical calculation. The newer versions do support symbolic calculation (via MuPAD) like Mathematica. The language is heavily matrix / vector based and most of the operators are defined for matrices with special cases for the element-wise use (* is matrix multiplication .* is element-wise multiplication).</p>
<p>With language as old as MATLAB, I can not make any guarantees on if the tasks would work for the first variants of the language.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1</strong></p>
<pre><code>'MATLAB was made in 1978'
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how I do not use &quot;;&quot; at the end. That woud suppress the output. The default behaviour is to save the result of any assignment-less result (like this) to variable &quot;ans&quot;. Because there is no semicolon after the statement the contents of the assignment variable (ans here) are printed out. You could use fprintf(format, ...) also.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2</strong></p>
<pre><code>function [] = printn(n)
    ROW = blanks(n);
    for i=1:n
        for j=1:n

<p>I have my doubts if strings were a part of the first version of the language but this is quite vanilla solution never the less. The empty brackets [] mean the function does not return any values.</p>

<p>Matlab does have gcd built-in so I used mygcd as the function name. I also assumed a and b are scalars. The stack-overflow also happened with the recursive version so I used iterative Euclid's algorithm. The function returns the value, so you'd need to print it yourself.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The much delayed successor to FORTRAN 77, informally known as Fortran
  90 (and prior to that, Fortran 8X), was finally released as ISO/IEC
  standard 1539:1991 in 1991 and an ANSI Standard in 1992. In addition
  to changing the official spelling from FORTRAN to Fortran, this major
  revision added many new features to reflect the significant changes in
  programming practice that had evolved since the 1978 standard</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>“Hello, World”</h3>

<p>In particular, Fortran 90 adds free-form source input (yay!), which is nice even for Hello World.</p>

<pre><code>program say_my_name
  print '(A)', "Fortran 90 was made in (you guessed it) 1991"
end program say_my_name
</code></pre>

<h3>ASCII art “N”</h3>

<p>In the ASCII art task, the handy <code>I0</code> format specifier from Fortran 95 has to go.  Too bad if you want to print <em>N</em> for <code>N ≥ 10¹⁰</code></p>

<pre><code>program paint_N
  integer            :: N, i
  character(len=500) :: fmt

  read*, N

  do i=1,N
     write(fmt, "('(', 2(A, ',', 'T', I11, ','), A, ')')") &amp;
          "'N'", i, "'N'", N, "'N'"
     print fmt
  end do
end program paint_N
</code></pre>

<h3>Greatest common divisor</h3>

<p>To compute the GCD, we use Euclid's algorithm because Fortran 90 lacks the bitwise operations. (Even if <code>ifort -e90</code> accepts them; <code>gfortran</code> has <code>-std=f95</code> but no corresponding <code>std=f90</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>program Euclidean_GCD_algorithm

<div id="pu48" class="pu"><h1>1979 - AWK</h1>

<p>AWK is a small programming language used by Unix wizards to process text files, optionally extracting data and computing some results. AWK was "<em>originally written in 1977, and distributed with Version 7 Unix</em>," but the latter was released in 1979, which is also where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_programming_languages">Wikipedia's timeine</a> lists it.</p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<p>AWK programs are often one-liners typed into a shell, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN { print "AWK was made in 1979!" }'
AWK was made in 1979!
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<p>Of course, you can put a program in a large file.</p>

<pre><code>function ascii_art(s) {
    result = "";
    for (i = 0; i &lt; s; i++) {
        if (i &gt; 0)
            result = result "\n";
        for (j = 0; j &lt; s; j++) {
            if (i == j || j == 0 || j == (s - 1))
                letter = "N";
            else
                letter = " ";
            result = result letter;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

{ print ascii_art($1) }
</code></pre>

<p>And run it as:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk -f ascii_art.awk
5
N   N
NN  N
N N N
N  NN
N   N
</code></pre>

<p>(That <code>5</code> is my input. AWK's "main" function always loops over all lines of input; I could've also passed in a file full of numbers.)</p>

<p>Interestingly, AWK has no real string concatenation operator: instead, you just write two string expressions next to each other, like <code>result = result letter</code>.</p>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p>This one's plain and simple:</p>

<pre><code>awk '{ while ($2 &gt; 0) { t = $1; $1 = $2; $2 = t % $2; } print $1 }'
30 20
10
</code></pre>

<p>Note how AWK has those <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> variables that retrive the <em>n</em>th "word" in the line -- this really demonstrates its specfic roots in processing text files.</p>

<div id="pu49" class="pu"><h1>1985 - <a href="http://miranda.org.uk/">Miranda</a></h1>

<p>(I actually wrote this earlier but forgot to post it. It is a landmark, however, and I think it deserves to be included.) </p>

<p>Miranda is the precursor to Haskell. It was the first purely functional language to be commercially supported (and not merely an academic endeavour). As such, it tried to have proper I/O and the like. </p>

<p>Miranda is a lot less sophisticated than Haskell, though. For one, monads had not been invented yet, so input would involve a lazily constructed list from a given input source (i.e <code>$-</code> is the list of characters on stdin, <code>$+</code> is the list of values of expressions in the input); output would involve an expression evaluating to a list of <em>system messages</em>, which would be obeyed in order as they become available. This had the problem, of course, that the result of a function application like <code>read "foo"</code> is not referentially transparent, because <code>foo</code> might have changed. </p>

<p>Thus, a Miranda <em>script</em> simply contains one expression to be evaluated (which would evaluate to a list of system messages), followed optionally by a list of definitions used in the expression. (All of mine just evaluate to a single <code>Stdout</code> message).</p>

<p>It is worth noting, given the syntax, that Haskell did not start as an extension to Miranda, it is just heavily inspired by it. </p>

<h3>Task 1</h3>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/mira -exp

<p>Can't believe someone put Turbo Pascal and not C++!</p>

<p>Everyone knows about C++, right? It's one of my favorite programming languages due to its speed and expressiveness (yes, it's expressive; template metaprogramming counts!).</p>

<p>Note that I originally used 1983 as the creation date, but then I ended up with an invalid answer. Besides, C with Classes was created in 1981, and that's what C++ was before it was renamed.</p>

<p>These examples were made based on what I know about the first version of C++ when it was actually called C++ and the headers included with cfront.</p>

<div id="pu51" class="pu"><h1>1980 - Ada</h1>

<p>In the 1970s, the United Stated Department of Defense
had a problem: their IT was often done ad-hoc, and used
hodgepodge of many different programming
languages, many of them specific to the hardware they
were used on, and none of them designed for military use. 
The DoD decided it was time for standardisation,
and one language was to be designed, which could do
everything from the payroll to the nuclear weapons. It
was to be designed for safety, in such a manner that the compiler
could catch as many programming mistakes as possible. On the
other hand, it was also targeted at embedded systems
(such as the aforementioned nukes). Committees were formed,
years passed, and in 1980 was born MIL-STD-1815, otherwise
known as Ada.</p>

<p>Thus, the type system is strict enough to make Pascal look like machine code,
there are run-time checks for everything, and the syntax uses mainly
English words, to catch typos. It was also one of the first languages
to include exception handling, and one of the first languages to explicitly
support concurrency in the syntax. The compiler could even catch potential
deadlocks. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, it ended up with the safety of a battle tank, the
reliability of a battle tank, but also the speed of a battle tank
and the aesthetics of a battle tank. 1980-s era computers
could barely run it, and it would take until 1987 for the language
to gain some use - and even then it was only because the military
mandated it. Compilers are large and difficult to write,
and take long to run because of all the checks they do.</p>

<p>Today, its drawbacks have been lessened by powerful hardware,
and its emphasis on safety still stands. It sees use mainly in fields where 
safety is very important
and software bugs could have disastrous consequences.
Aside from the military, it is used in such things as air traffic
control systems, railway transport, spaceflight, and sometimes banking. </p>

<div id="pu52" class="pu"><h1>1982 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript" rel="noreferrer">PostScript</a></h1>
<p>PostScript is a language for creating vector graphics and printing.</p>
<p>Adobe was founded in 1982, and their first product was PostScript. The language was used in printers: the commands are interpreted by the printer to create a raster image, which is then printed onto the page. It was a very common component of laser printers well into the 1990s. But it’s obviously quite CPU intensive on the printer, and as computer processors became more powerful, it made more sense to do the rasterisation on the computer than the printer. PostScript has largely gone away on consumer printers, although it still exists on a lot of more high-end printers.</p>
<p>The standard which replaced PostScript is a little-known format called PDF.</p>
<p>PostScript had fallen out of fashion by the time I started programming, but I learnt a little bit while I was in university as another way of creating documents for TeX. It was quite different to other programming languages I’d used (reverse infix notation, stack, printing to a page instead of a console), but it was nice to dust off this old language for some fun.</p>
<p>Since PostScript is a printing language, it seems more appropriate to use it to print something then send an output to the console.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I wrote a function for drawing the “ASCII art” N, but there’s no way for PostScript functions to take an argument. Instead, you push your arguments to the stack, then get them back off. That’s the <code>/x exch def</code> line.</p>
<p>An example: suppose the stack is <code>8 9 2</code>. First we push the name <code>/x</code> to the stack, so the stack is <code>8 9 2 /x</code>. The <code>exch</code> operator swaps the two stack values, so now the stack is <code>8 9 /x 2</code>. Then <code>def</code> pops the top two stack values, and defines <code>/x</code> to have the value <code>2</code>. The stack is now <code>8 9</code>.</p>
<p>When I started using PostScript, I found this a little confusing. I’d read about the stack as a theoretical concept, but this was the first time I was using it in practice.</p>
<p>The rest of the function is some drawing code: start at the bottom right-hand corner, filling in a row at a time from left-to-right-to-diagonal.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Again, I used a form of Euclid’s algorithm, but I’d forgotten that PostScript has a built in modulo operator, so I had to write my own. This turned out to be a useful reminder of the constraints of stack-based programming. My first implementation of <code>modulo</code> was based on recursion:</p>
<pre><code>modulo(x, y)
    if (x = y) return 0
    elif (x &lt; y) return x
    else return module(x - y, y)
</code></pre>
<p>which is fine until you try to run this when <code>x</code> is large and <code>y</code> is small (e.g. 5689 and 2). You can only have up to 250 elements on the stack, and so I was blowing well past the stack limit. Oops. I had to go back to the drawing board on that one.</p>
<p>The GCD code itself is fairly simple. But just as functions can’t take arguments, so they don’t have return values. Instead, you have to push the result to the stack where somebody else can pop it off later. That’s what the <code>a</code> and <code>b a gcd</code> lines do: when they’ve finished evaluating, they push the value to the stack.</p>
<p>If you put all the code in a document and print it, this is what the output looks like:</p>

<p>This script uses the fact that the crossing character (that is, the line that travels diagonally from top left to bottom right in the character <code>N</code>) is always   populated at position <code>y</code> in the row - where <code>y</code> is the current column (<code>if %%b==%%a set c=N</code>). Then the first and last character in each row is always populated. The first for loop defines rows, and the inner for loop defines columns.</p>

<p>When doing anything even remotely complicated in Batch, there always tends to be a lot of nested for loops. The first set of loops creates two lists which contain every number from 1 to <code>n</code> which divides evenly into the <code>n</code>, where <code>n</code> is either of the inputted values. The second loops just compare each value in one list to each value in the other, until the highest value that exists in both lists is found. Just a note that Batch doesn't actually have arrays, so all I have done is created a bunch of variables with uniform names.</p>

<p>Haskell is a popular (or should I say: <em>the most popular</em>?) pure functional language.

<div id="pu60" class="pu"><h1>2015 - Muffin<em>MC</em></h1>

<p>Muffin<em>MC</em> is a Turing-complete, funny (but serious), functional and minimalist macro-language written by Franck Porcher (<a href="http://franckys.com" rel="noreferrer">http://franckys.com</a>) in mid-February 2015 out of necessity as a (quick) tool to empower a spreadsheet
to be used as the only front-end controller to pilot and drive all inventory-related operations associated with a Prestashop-based merchant site for a new Tahitian fashion brand : <em>Mutiny Tahiti</em> (<a href="http://mutinytahiti.com" rel="noreferrer">http://mutinytahiti.com</a> -- soon to be launched).</p>

<p>Muffin<em>MC</em> is an acronym for <strong>MU</strong>tiny <strong>F</strong>unctional <strong>F</strong>lexible <strong>IN</strong>line <strong>M</strong>acro <strong>C</strong>ommand language.</p>

<p>To meet our requirements, Muffin<em>MC</em>'s core features have been designed around flexible and efficient 1st-class built-in semantic constructs like <em>iterators</em>, <em>lazy-evaluation</em>, <em>multi-functors</em>, <em>string-product</em>.</p>

<p>Muffin<em>MC</em> draws its roots in (pragmatic) functional programming, FLisp and Perl. It fully supports recursivity (without any optimization), is dynamically typed and dynamically scoped (shallow-binding). It offers its users one data structure only, apart from basic data-types atoms (atoms, strings, numerals) : lists !</p>

<p>Muffin<em>MC</em> list semantics (kind of) borrows on <em>power-set</em> semantics, that is :</p>

<ol>
<li>All Muffin<em>MC</em> operation yield a list, possibly empty.</li>
<li>Access to an any individual list element always yields a one-value-list made of that element (think of it as a singleton).</li>
<li>The empty list is the neutral element on list operations.</li>
</ol>

<p>To reconcile with this, the following may help :</p>

<ul>
<li>One may visualize a list as the element of the list's power-set that has the greatest cardinality.</li>
<li>Visualize a list's element as the element of the list's power-set that is the singleton made of that element.</li>
<li>Visualize an empty list as the empty-set; that is, the only element of the empty-set's power-set.</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, accessing an empty list element yields the empty-list, and not an error! Indeed, Muffin<em>MC</em> tries hard to throw as few errors as possible by extending that way the semantics of many traditional operations.</p>

<h1>Task 1</h1>

<pre><code>#(say "MuffinMC was born in 2015 out of necessity !")
</code></pre>

<p><code>#(...)</code> is the Muffin<em>MC</em> macro command for applying a function on a non-evaled argument list, here the built-in function <code>say</code>, borrowed from Perl.</p>

<p><code>#(say 1 2 3 ...)</code> is functionally identical to <code>map {say $_} (1,2,3,...)</code></p>

<h1>Task 2</h1>

<p>Define the function <code>ascii-art()</code> :</p>

<pre><code>=(ascii-art
    '( =(*  x   #(2- $(_1))
        I   I( *($(x) " ") N)
            foo '( #(. #(I $(x))) ))
    #(say ?( #(== $(_1) 1) N "N#(map foo #(.. 1 $(_1)))N" ))
 ))
</code></pre>

<p><code>Ascii-art()</code>'s shortest working form (88 bytes) :</p>

<pre><code>=(f'(=(* x#(2-)I I(*($(x)" ")N)g'(#(.#(I$(x)))))#(say?(#(==$(_1)1)N"N#(map g#(..))N"))))
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p><code>=(var val...)</code> is the Muffin<em>MC</em> macro command to define a variable, or reassign it.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$(var)</code> is the Muffin<em>MC</em> macro command to access a variable's value. It naturally accepts the form <code>$(v1 v2 ...)</code> to access many variables at once. </p></li>
<li><p><code>=(* var1 val1 var2 val2 ...)</code> is the extension of Muffin<em>MC</em> macro command <code>=(...)</code> to deal with parallel assignments.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables <code>_1, _2</code>, ... are dynamically scoped (shallow binding mechanism) and automatically set to bind to the function's arguments. Borrowed from Perl5, system variables <code>#</code> (number of arguments) and <code>@</code> (list of arguments) are also automatically set.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions are simply variables bound to any number of Muffin<em>MC</em> statements.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This interesting solution comes from combining two natural Muffin<em>MC</em> built-in features :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Muffin<em>MC</em> <code>I(...)</code> macro command, to define cycling-iterators, later used with the functional form <code>#(my-iterator want-number-of-values)</code>,</p></li>
<li><p>The Muffin<em>MC</em> <em>string-product</em> construct, an extension of the natural variable interpolation, which, given any string <code>"F1 F2 F3..."</code>, where the F<em>i</em>s are either Muffin<em>MC</em> string literals or Muffin<em>MC</em> macro command (aka functional forms), will produce as many strings as given by the product cardinal(F1) x cardinal(F2) x ... .</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For instance, given x a variable that holds 2 values, says a and b, and y another variable that holds 3 values, says, 1 2 3, then the evaluation of the string <code>"x=$(x) y=$(y))"</code> will produce 6 different values, namely, in that order :</p>

<ul>
<li>"x=a y=1"</li>
<li>"x=a y=2"</li>
<li>"x=a y=3"</li>
<li>"x=b y=1"</li>
<li>"x=b y=2"</li>
<li>"x=b y=3"</li>
</ul>

<p>This is one of MUTINY project's highly desirable features Muffin<em>MC</em> was designed for.</p>

<p>Run it !</p>

<h3>How does it work</h3>

<p>Our algorithm is based on the followings:</p>

<p>Given a call to ascii-art(n), {n = 2p+1 | p integer, p>= 0}, the art to generate comprises n strings of n characters, amongst which, two, the leftest and rightest, are fixed and always the same : 'N'. This allows to reduce the problem in producing only the middle strings. For instance, given n=5, we would weed to produce the 5 following middle strings, each made of n-2 characters (we have replaced the space by a '_' for the sake of better visualization) :</p>

<pre><code>    The 5 strings :
        _ _ _
        N _ _ 
        _ N _
        _ _ N
        _ _ _

    can be seen as resulting from splitting in groups of 3 characters
    the following infinite sequence of 4 characters :


        /---- &lt; _ _ _ N &gt; ----\
       |                       |
        \---------------------/    


    which, once unfolded, yields the infinite ruban : 

        _ _ _ N _ _ _ N _ _ _ N _ _ _ N _ _ _ N _ _ _ N ...
              ^     ^     ^     ^     
        _ _ _ |     |     |     |
              N _ _ |     |     | 
                    _ N _ |     |
                          _ _ N |
                                _ _ _
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Such middle strings can easily be produced by cycling over the 4 elements sequence <code>('_'  '_'  '_'  'N')</code> in 5 groups of 3 ; given n, the function's input, such sequence is made of  n-2 characters <code>'_'</code>, followed by the character <code>'N'</code>. Cycling over this sequence requires nothing else but embedding the sequence within a Muffin<em>MC</em> <code>I(sequence)</code> built-in iterator (an iterator that cycles forever over its initial sequence of values).</p></li>
<li><p>We then simply produce the middle strings, of length n-2, by asking our iterator to give us its next n-2 values (n - 2 characters), which are  concatenated together to produce the expected middle string.</p></li>
<li><p>The n middle strings are produced by repeating n times the above process, using a map to collect the n results (n strings of n-2 characters).</p></li>
<li><p>We use another powerful Muffin<em>MC</em> built-in construct, namely the <em>string product</em>, to produce the n final strings : <code>"N#(map...)N"</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>And that's it !</p>

<div id="pu63" class="pu"><h1>1992 - Dylan</h1>

<p>Dylan is a multi-paradigm programming language, that has support for both functional and object-oriented programming. It was originally written at Apple to be the programming language for the Newton, but that went wrong, and the Newton's software ended up written in a combination of C and a stripped-down version of Self named NewtonScript.</p>

<p>Despite its syntax, Dylan is a Lisp derivative. Some of the syntax does show it, however: variable names like <code>this-one</code> and <code>*this*one*</code> are considered valid, and thus operators need to be seperated from their arguments by spaces. Dylan also has Lisp-style macros that can actually extend the syntax to some extent. For example, the <code>for</code> construct as used in the ASCII art example is actually a macro, not a built-in.</p>

<p>Actually compiling a Dylan program is a bit of a hassle. You need to define at least a library, a module, and a library interchange file (LID), in three different files. Because both the library and the LID are basically only boilerplate for small programs like these, I have provided only the modules. <a href="http://opendylan.org" rel="nofollow">OpenDylan</a>, which I used, can generate all the necessary boilerplate for you using <code>make-dylan-app &lt;name&gt;</code>. </p>

<h3>Task 1</h3>

<pre><code>Module: task1
format-out("Dylan was created in 1992!\n");
</code></pre>

<h3>Task 2</h3>

<pre><code>Module: asciin

define function N (size :: &lt;integer&gt;)
  for (line from 1 to size)
    for (col from 1 to size)
      format-out(

          "N"
        else
          " "

      );
    end for;
    format-out("\n");
  end for;
end function N;

N(string-to-integer(application-arguments()[0]));
</code></pre>

<h3>Task 3</h3>

<p>Dylan has a built-in <code>gcd</code> function, so all you need to do is write an I/O wrapper:</p>

<pre><code>Module: gcd
format-out("%d",apply(gcd,map(string-to-integer,application-arguments())));
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you want to write your own <code>gcd</code>, you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Module: customgcd
define function my-gcd (a :: &lt;integer&gt;, b :: &lt;integer&gt;)
   if (b = 0)
      a
   else
      my-gcd(b, modulo(a, b))
   end if
end function my-gcd;

format-out("%d\n",apply(my-gcd,map(string-to-integer,application-arguments())));

<p>This also shows how it is a multi-paradigm language: <code>N</code> from task 2 is written in imperative style, <code>my-gcd</code> is written in functional style. </p>

<p>Note the C-inspired for loop syntax (though with semicolon and <code>do</code>/<code>done</code>); one quirk there is that the variable names don't use <code>$</code> anywhere in the loop header. (Typically, shell variables stand without the <code>$</code> only in assignments, like <code>x=5</code>.) The first command-line argument is available as <code>$1</code>. The double parens perform an arithmetic evaluation, which conveniently also supports comparison and boolean operators. Passing the <code>-n</code> option to <code>echo</code> suppresses the trailing newline; I decided to stop the inner loop short of the final column so I could use <code>echo 'N'</code> to print the last <code>N</code> and the newline at the same time.</p>
<h3>Task 3</h3>
<pre><code>gcd() {
        if (($1));
        then
                gcd $(($2 % $1)) $1;
        else
                echo $2;
        fi
}

gcd $1 $2
</code></pre>
<p>Invoke as <code>zsh task2.zsh 2706 410</code>.</p>
<p>Here we get to define a function <code>gcd</code>. It is called just like a shell command, with space-separated arguments. Within the function, parameters are referenced with the same <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc. as command-line arguments to a script. By using arithmetic evaluation in the condition, we can test if the argument is nonzero the same way as in C or Python.</p>
<p>The oddest thing (to me) is that you don't return the return value--you output it to STDOUT. (The <code>return</code> command sets the function's <em>exit status</em>, which is problematic if you're dealing with values outside the 0 to 255 range!) If you need to store the result instead of displaying it, just use <code>retval=$(gcd $1 $2)</code>.</p>

It's very powerful and pretty awesome, taking a very different approach to several concepts. It features a dynamic plugin system (YES!!!!), a C++ code generator (the standard library's <code>string</code> type is just a wrapper over the C++ <code>std::string</code>), and a nice syntax. It also takes a unique approach to things such as calls (like Nim, <code>a.b</code> == 'b a'), indexing (calling an integer with a sequence indexes it), a grammar defined in user-space (a.k.a. you can extend the grammar inside your Felix script), and lvalues/rvales (there are <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/felix-language/lvalue%7Csort:date/felix-language/OJ02U1IAPG0/discussion" rel="nofollow noreferrer">none</a>!).</p>
<p>The only real issue is that lack of half-decent documentation, but there are plenty of examples (the driver, the web server, the utilities: all written in Felix) and a very helpful <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/felix-language" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby was introduced 20 years ago by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. Ruby was mainly influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada and Lisp. </p>

<p>According to its website, Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write, which very true since well-written Ruby reads a lot like English.</p>

<p>It is a good choice for someone's first programming language.</p>

<p>Ruby has a extensive library of gems. It is very popular for the Ruby on Rails framework which many modern websites are built upon.</p>

<h3>Task 1 - Hello World Variant</h3>

<pre><code>puts "Ruby was made in 1995!"
</code></pre>

<h3>Task 2 - Ascii Art</h3>

<pre><code>n = gets.to_i
ascii_art = n.times.map do |i|
    n.times.map do |j|
        (j == 0 || j == i || j == (n - 1)) ? "N" : " "
    end.join
end.join("\n")
puts ascii_art
</code></pre>

<h3>Task 3 - GCD</h3>

<pre><code>def gcd(a, b)
    b.zero? ? a : gcd(b, a % b)
end

puts gcd(*gets.split.map(&amp;:to_i))
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty simple implementation of GCD. The last line might be a confusing but what it's basically doing is getting a line of input, splitting it into two integers and passing that as the argument to the gcd function.</p>

<p>You can also use lambdas for a shorter implementation:</p>

<pre><code>gcd = -&gt;(a, b) { b.zero? ? a : gcd.(b, a % b) }

gcd.(27, 36)
</code></pre>

<div id="pu68" class="pu"><h1>1995 - JavaScript</h1>

<p>We all know all about JS already, let's just cut to the chase. No? All right.</p>

<p>JS the <strong>the</strong> language for the web. It's been supported by the major browsers practically since its inception.</p>

<p>JavaScript is like Java the way a car is like a carpet. Sure, they're both transportation vehicles, but the similarity ends around there.</p>

<p>JS has uses outside of the web too. Most prominent is <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.JS</a>. The JS core is actually pretty simple - objects, functions, regex, arrays, keywords, etc. It's then built up -- DOM functions in browsers; filesystem, command line, and HTTP modules for Node. Some might say that the [Canvas / AJAX / Speech Synthesis] API is its own extension as well.</p>

<p>In addition to core extensions (which are built in by the interpreter), there are innumerable plugins as well. Some notable ones include jQuery, jQuery, and moar jQuery.</p>

<p>That's enough for now. Let's get to the challenges!</p>

<h2>Task #1 - "Hello, World!" Variant</h2>

<pre><code>document.write("JavaScript was made in 1995!");
</code></pre>

<p>This is really bad form, but it's still valid. <code>document.write()</code> writes to the DOM.</p>

<h2>Task #2 - ASCII Art N</h2>

<pre><code>function N(n){
    var l = [], i, j;
    for (i=0; i&lt;n; i++){
        l[i] = ["N"];
        for(j=1; j&lt;n; j++){
            l[i][j] = j == i || j == n-1 ? "N" : " ";
        }
        l[i] = l[i].join('');
    }
    return l.join('\n');
}
alert(N(prompt("n?")));
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty straightforward. Create a function, use a couple loops, and create an array with <code>N</code>s, then join the arrays. The last line will use an <code>alert()</code> after a <code>prompt()</code>. <code>alert()</code> does output; <code>prompt()</code> does input. Call our function between that.</p>

<h2>Task #3 - GCD</h2>

<pre><code>function GCD(a,b){
    return b==0 ? a : GCD(b, a % b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Simple Euclidian algorithm. Uses a recursive function. Note that this only creates a function; it doesn't use it anywhere.</p>

<div id="pu71" class="pu"><h1>2000 - ActionScript</h1>
<p>ActionScript is a member of the ECMAScript family, developed for scripting the animation software Flash. By making Flash programmable, it allowed for interactive menus, games, etc.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 was released in September of 2000 as part of Flash 5. Although Flash 4 had a simple scripting language known as &quot;Actions,&quot; ActionScript 1.0 added significant new features such as user-defined functions, so I claim 2000 as the year of origin for ActionScript. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript" rel="noreferrer">Source: Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>On a personal note: ActionScript was the second programming language I learned, after QBasic. I still remember with great fondness the fractal generators, cipher machines, and vegetable-shooting games I created with it. Going back to it for this post was fun.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: These examples are tested with ActionScript 2.0, which is the oldest version I have access to. I've never used ActionScript 1.0. But as far as I know, I haven't used any 2.0-specific language features here.</p>
<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>The easy way would be to output the text to a debugging window via <code>trace()</code>. But this is an animation software--we can do better.</p>
<pre><code>createTextField(&quot;field_txt&quot;, 0, 0, 0, 200, 50);
field_txt.text = &quot;ActionScript was made in 2000!&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJpjI.png" alt="ActionScript &quot;Hello World&quot; variant" /></p>
<h3>Task 2</h3>
<p>The next two examples assume that text boxes with the appropriate names and properties have already been created. One can do this programmatically, as above, or by putting them on the stage with the GUI. The latter saves a lot of typing, of course.</p>
<pre><code>input_txt.onChanged = function() {
    number = int(input_txt.text);
    output_txt.text = &quot;&quot;;
    for(i = 0; i &lt; number; i++) {
        for(j = 0; j &lt; number; j++) {
            if(j == i || j == 0 || j == number - 1) {
                output_txt.text += &quot;N&quot;;
            } else {
                output_txt.text += &quot; &quot;;
            }
        }
        output_txt.text += &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's helpful to set <code>output_txt</code> to a monospace font.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SN7RJ.png" alt="ActionScript ASCII &quot;N&quot;" /></p>
<h3>Task 3</h3>

    if(a_txt.text &amp;&amp; b_txt.text) {
        a = int(a_txt.text);
        b = int(b_txt.text);
        while(a &gt; 0) {
            tmp = b;
            b = a;
            a = tmp % a;
        }
        output_txt.text = &quot;GCD is &quot; + b;

<p>Eagle-eyed viewers will note that my solution is essentially JavaScript with a different title; JavaScript is supposed to be compliant with ECMAScript, and then add a few features of its own. As such, I was able to write this without having to look up any ECMAScript syntax.</p>

Otherwise, it will executes <code>[dup rollup rem]</code> （if the stack is <code>[Y X]</code> it will become <code>[X%Y Y]</code>）, then recursively call itself.

<div id="pu76" class="pu"><h1>2015 - <a href="https://github.com/mbuettner/retina" rel="noreferrer">Retina</a></h1>
<p>Retina is a regex-based programming language, which I wrote to be able to compete in PPCG challenges with regex-only answers, without having the unnecessary overhead of calling the regex in some host language. Retina is Turing-complete. To prove it I've implemented <a href="https://github.com/mbuettner/retina/tree/master/Examples" rel="noreferrer">a 2-tag system solver as well as Rule 110</a>. It is written in C#, hence it supports both the .NET flavour (by default) and the ECMAScript flavour (via a flag).</p>
<p>Retina can operate in multiple modes, but the most relevant one for computations (and the Turing-complete one) is Replace mode. In Replace mode you give Retina an even number of source files. These are then paired, the first of each pair being a regex, and the second a replacement. These are then executed in order, manipulating the input step by step. The regex can also be preceded by a configuration (delimited with <code>`</code>). The most important option (which makes Retina Turing-complete) is <code>+</code>, which makes Retina apply the replacement in a loop until the result stops changing. In the following examples, I'm also using <code>;</code>, which suppresses output on intermediate stages.</p>
<p>In each of the following submissions, each line goes in a separate source file. (Alternatively, you can use the new <code>-s</code> option and put all lines into a single file.) Empty files/lines are represented as <code>&lt;empty&gt;</code>. Files/lines containing a single space are represented as <code>&lt;space&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2>Explanations</h2>
<h3>&quot;Hello, World!&quot; Variant</h3>
<p>This is fairly trivial. It takes no input (i.e. an empty string), matches nothing and replaces it with <code>Retina was made in 2015!</code>. One can also make it work for arbitrary input, by replacing the pattern with <code>[\s\S]*</code> for instance. That would slurp STDIN and replace all of it with the output.</p>
<h3>ASCII Art N</h3>
<p>This has quite a lot of stages. The idea is to convert the input to unary, create an N x N block of <code>N</code>s and then &quot;carve out&quot; two triangles. Let's go through the individual stages. Remember that <code>;</code> merely suppresses intermediate outputs, but <code>+</code> causes the replacement to be applied in a loop.</p>
<pre><code>;`^
#
</code></pre>
<p>Simple: prepend a <code>#</code> to the input. This will be used as a marker in the conversion to unary.</p>
<pre><code>;+`(\d*)#(?:(((((((((9)|8)|7)|6)|5)|4)|3)|2)|1)|0)
$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$2$3$4$5$6$7$8$9$10#
</code></pre>
<p>This converts one digit to unary. It takes the digits already converted <code>(\d*)</code> and repeats them 10 times. And then it takes the next digit and appends the appropriate number of digits. The actual value of the digits is irrelevant at this stage. When the <code>#</code> reaches the end of the number, the regex no longer matches, and the conversion is done. As an example, the number <code>127</code> will be processed as</p>
<pre><code>#127
1#27
111111111122#7
1111111111221111111111221111111111221111111111221111111111221111111111221111111111221111111111221111111111221111111111227777777#
</code></pre>
<p>where the last line contains exactly 127 digit characters.</p>
<pre><code>;`#
&lt;empty&gt;
;`\d
N
</code></pre>
<p>Two simple stages which get rid of that <code>#</code> and then convert all the digits to <code>N</code>. In the following I'll use input <code>7</code> as an example. So now we've got</p>
<pre><code>NNNNNNN
</code></pre>
<p>The next stage</p>
<pre><code>;`.(?&lt;=(?=(.*\n)).*)|\n
$1
</code></pre>
<p>replaces each <code>N</code> with the entire string (remember that it contains a trailing newline), and also removes the trailing newline itself. Hence, this turns the single row into a square grid:</p>
<pre><code>NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN   
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
</code></pre>
<p>Now the upper triangle. First, we start things off by turning the N in the lower right corner into a space:</p>
<pre><code>;`N(?=N\n.*\n.*\n`$)
&lt;space&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The lookahead ensures that we're modifying the correct <code>N</code>. This gives</p>
<pre><code>NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN   
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
NNNNN N
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
</code></pre>
<p>And now</p>
<pre><code>;+`N(?=.?(.)+\n.* (?&lt;-1&gt;.)+(?(1)!)\n)
&lt;space&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>is a regex which matches an <code>N</code> which is above or at the top left corner of a space character, and replaces it with a space. Because the replacement is repeated, this is essentially a flood-fill, which turns the 3rd octant from the initial space into more spaces:</p>
<pre><code>N     N
NN    N   
NNN   N
NNNN  N
NNNNN N
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, we repeat the same thing with the bottom triangle, but we use a different character, so the already existing spaces don't cause a wrong flood fill:</p>
<pre><code>;`(?&lt;=^.*\n.*\nN)N
S
</code></pre>
<p>sets the seed:</p>
<pre><code>N     N
NN    N   
NSN   N
NNNN  N
NNNNN N
NNNNNNN
NNNNNNN
</code></pre>
<p>Then</p>
<pre><code>;+`(?&lt;=\n(?(1)!)(?&lt;-1&gt;.)+S.*\n(.)+N?)N
S
</code></pre>
<p>does the flood-fill.</p>
<pre><code>N     N
NN    N   
NSN   N
NSSN  N
NSSSN N
NSSSSNN
NSSSSSN
</code></pre>
<p>And finally</p>
<pre><code>S
&lt;space&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Turns those <code>S</code> into spaces and we're done:</p>
<pre><code>N     N
NN    N   
N N   N
N  N  N
N   N N
N    NN
N     N
</code></pre>
<h3>GCD</h3>
<p>GCD in unary is actually very trivial with regex. Most of this consists of the decimal to unary and unary to decimal conversion. This could be done more compactly, but this isn't a code golf, so...</p>
<pre><code>;`\b(?=\d)
#
;+`(\d*)#(?:(((((((((9)|8)|7)|6)|5)|4)|3)|2)|1)|0)
$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$2$3$4$5$6$7$8$9$10#
;`#
&lt;empty&gt;
;`\d
1
</code></pre>
<p>These stages are essentially the same as above, except that both input numbers are converted, and the result uses <code>1</code>s instead of <code>N</code>s (not that it matters). So if the input was <code>18 24</code>, then this would produce</p>
<pre><code>111111111111111111 111111111111111111111111
</code></pre>
<p>Now</p>
<pre><code>;`^(.+)\1* \1+$
$1
</code></pre>
<p><strong>is the entire GCD computation.</strong> We match a common divisor by capturing a number of <code>1</code>s, and then using backreferences to ensure that both numbers can be written by repeating that string (and nothing else). Due to how backtracking works in the regex engine (i.e. that <code>.+</code> is greedy), this will always yield the <em>greatest</em> common divisor automatically. Since the match covers the entire string, we simply write back the first capturing group to get our GCD.</p>
<p>Finally, the unary to decimal conversion...</p>
<pre><code>;`$
#:0123456789
</code></pre>
<p>Append a marker <code>#</code>, a delimiter <code>:</code> and all digits to the string. This is necessary, because you can't produce new characters conditionally in a regex replacement. If you want conditional replacement, you need to pull the characters from the string itself, so we put them there.</p>
<pre><code>;+`^(?=1)(1*)\1{9}(#(?=.*(0))|1#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;1))|11#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;2))|111#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;3))|1111#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;4))|11111#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;5))|111111#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;6))|1111111#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;7))|11111111#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;8))|111111111#(?=.*(?&lt;3&gt;9)))
$1#$3
</code></pre>
<p>This is the inverse of the unary expansion earlier. We find the largest multiple of 10 that fits into the current string. Then we choose the next digit based on the remainder, and divide the multiple by 10, while moving the marker through the digits.</p>
<pre><code>#|:.*
&lt;empty&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And lastly just a cleanup step to get rid of the marker, delimiter and the helper digits.</p>

<div id="pu82" class="pu"><h1>2009 - Go</h1>

<p>Go is programming language developed by Google. The development started in 2007, but Go was announced in November 2009. </p>

<p>Go is a statically-typed language influenced by C which emphasizes conciseness, simplicity, and safety. </p>

<h2>Task 1:</h2>

<pre><code>package main
import "fmt"

func main(){
    fmt.Println("Go was made in 2009!")
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first line declares the package of the code. Even a simple example as printing one line needs to be part of one package. And the executable is always called <code>main</code>. </p>

<h2>Task 2:</h2>

<pre><code>package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "strings"
)

func main(){
    var n int
    fmt.Scan(&amp;n)

    for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
        a := make([]string, n, n)
        for j := 0; j &lt; n; j++ { a[j] = " " }

        a[0] = "N"
        a[i] = "N"
        a[n-1] = "N"

        s := strings.Join(a, "")
        fmt.Println(s)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Go has a quite concise variable declaration (<code>i := 0</code> is the same as <code>var i int = 0</code>), and the compiler determines the type. This is usually a feature more common in dynamic languages. Using this short notation it's also really easy to assign functions to variables (<code>f := func(x int) int {/* Code */}</code>) and create Closures. </p>

<h2>Task 3:</h2>

<pre><code>package main

import "fmt"

func gcd(a, b int) int {
    for b != 0 {
        a, b = b, a%b
    }
    return a
}

func main(){
    var a, b int
    fmt.Scan(&amp;a)
    fmt.Scan(&amp;b)

    fmt.Println(gcd(a, b))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see the 
<code>a, b = b, a%b</code> syntax, which is really nice. I don't know the exact name, but in Python it's called tuple unpacking. Using the same way you can return multiple values from a function (<code>func f() (int, string) { return 42, "Hallo"}</code>). </p>

<p>Another thing happening in this code is the loop. The for loop is the only loop in Go. While-loops or do-while-loops don't exists. But you can easily create an equivalent for the while loop <code>for condition {}</code> or an infinite loop <code>for {}</code>. </p>

<div id="pu86" class="pu"><h1>2006 - PowerShell</h1>
<p>PowerShell is a scripting and administration language that runs on top of the .NET framework, and duly has access to all the libraries we know and love, and uses a pipe-line to get everything done. I really don't know much about PowerShell, maybe someone who does can fill in the History for me, but I believe there are a number of people who don't like that a whole swathe of commands start with hyphens (&quot;-&quot;), I can't say I care all that much.</p>
<p>As is so often the case in these weird scripting languages, PowerShell uses the dollar symbol to denote variables. In PowerShell, a line-feed and a semi-colon are (as far as I am aware) synonymous.</p>
<p>All of the following was tested with PowerShell version 1, I think, I'm not sure what the <code>-version</code> flag does when calling PowerShell.</p>
<h2>Task 1</h2>

<pre class="lang-powershell prettyprint-override"><code>echo &quot;PowerShell was made in 2006!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><code>Echo</code> is an alias for <code>Write-Output</code> is how to output stuff in PowerShell, I'm not sure I quite understand it.</p>
<h2>Task 2</h2>
<p>There are two types of &quot;loop&quot; here, the for loop of <code>$i</code> from <code>1</code> to <code>$n</code>, and a &quot;foreach-object&quot; filter (aliased as &quot;%&quot;) over a seqence from <code>1</code> to <code>$n</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-powershell prettyprint-override"><code>function N()
{
    # the param construct lets you do all sorts of weird things
    param($n = 5)

    for($i = 1; $i -le $n; $i++)
    {
        echo ((1..$n | % {if ($_ -eq 1 -or $_ -eq $n -or $_ -eq $i) {&quot;N&quot;} else {&quot; &quot;}}) -join '')
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can call the function with a parameter or just as it is, and it will use the default of 5. These all produce the same result.</p>
<pre class="lang-powershell prettyprint-override"><code>N
N 5
N -n 5
$i=5;N $i
N(2+3)
</code></pre>
<p>See how we can also explicitly name the parameter (with the <code>-n</code> flag), and that the parenthesis are just contain an expression, and are not used for function calls.</p>
<p>By sticking this same code in a file on it's own, removing the <code>function {</code> and closing <code>}</code> bits, you can create a PowerShell script file which you call with the <code>.</code> command, and can be passed arguments just like a function.</p>
<pre class="lang-powershell prettyprint-override"><code>. N.ps1 7
. N.ps1 -n 11
</code></pre>
<h2>Task 3</h2>
<p>Below is a simple recursive gcd using the Euclidean algorithm as suggested. Note that the <code>return</code> is effectively optional, and is omitted before the recursive call. <code>return</code> yields a value and exits, without it you can continue to output stuff (but we do not do this here so it doesn't matter). Also note the short-hand for parameters in function calls (would need a <code>param</code> clause to make this into a runnable script file).</p>
<pre class="lang-powershell prettyprint-override"><code>function gcd($a, $b)
{
    if ($b -eq 0)
    {
        return $a
    }
    else
    {
        gcd $b ($a % $b)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I am always surprised that % is mod, and not -mod.</p>

<div id="pu87" class="pu"><h1>2009 - <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish" rel="noreferrer">>&lt;></a></h1>

<p>Inspired by Befunge, >&lt;> (Fish) is an esoteric stack-based 2D language, i.e. program flow can be up, down, left or right. The initial version of >&lt;> featured multithreading where <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> created and ended threads, but for simplicity reasons these instructions were changed to creating and removing new stacks respectively.</p>

<p>The current official interpreter for >&lt;> can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6392418" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. Unfortunately, the link to the old interpreter on Esolang wiki is broken.</p>

<h2>"Hello, World!" Variant</h2>

<pre><code>"!9002 ni edam saw &gt;&lt;&gt;"l?!;obb+0.
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the string is written backwards — >&lt;> doesn't technically have strings, with the only data type being a weird mix of char, int and float. <code>"</code> toggles string parsing, pushing each character onto the stack until a closing <code>"</code> is met.</p>

<p>The second half of the code then pushes the length of the stack <code>l</code>, checks if it's zero <code>?!</code> and if so the program terminates <code>;</code>. Otherwise the instruction pointer continues, outputting the top of the stack with <code>o</code> before executing <code>bb+0.</code>, which teleports the pointer to position <code>(22, 0)</code> just before the <code>l</code>, creating a loop.</p>

<h2>ASCII Art N</h2>

<pre><code>&amp;0 &gt; :&amp;:&amp;:*=?;  :&amp;:&amp;%  :0=?v  :&amp;:&amp;1-=?v  :{:{-&amp;:&amp;,{=?v   " " o   \

                           &gt; ~"N"o                           v    
   +                                  &gt; ~"N"oao              v    
   1                                                 &gt;"N"o   v    

   \                                                         &lt;   /
</code></pre>

<p>With spacing for clarity. You can try this out at the new online interpreter <a href="http://fishlanguage.com/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and see the instruction pointer go around and around — just remember to enter a number in the "Initial Stack" textbox. If you're running via the Python interpreter, use the <code>-v</code> flag to initialise the stack, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>py -3 fish.py ascii.fish -v 5
</code></pre>

<p>For this program, we put the input <code>n</code> into the register with <code>&amp;</code> and push a 0, which we'll call <code>i</code> for "iterations". The rest of the program is a giant loop which goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>:&amp;:&amp;:*=?;          If i == n*n, halt. Otherwise ...
:&amp;:&amp;%              Push i%n
:0=?v              If i%n == 0 ...
&gt;~"N"o               Print "N"
:&amp;:&amp;1-=?v          Else if i%n == n-1 ...
&gt;~"N"oao             Print "N" and a newline
:{:{-&amp;:&amp;,{=?v      Else if i%n == i//n, where // is integer division...
&gt;~"N"o               Print "N"
" "o               Otherwise, print a space
1+                 Increment i
</code></pre>

<p>Then we repeat the loop from the beginning.</p>

<p>The arrows <code>^&gt;v&lt;</code> change the direction of program flow and the mirrors <code>/\</code> reflect the direction of program flow.</p>

<h2>GCD</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;:{:}%\
;n{v?:/
v~@/
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example of what a golfed >&lt;> program might look like. Once again, you can try this in the <a href="http://fishlanguage.com/" rel="noreferrer">online interpreter</a> (enter two comma-separated values in the "Initial stack" box, e.g. <code>111, 87</code>) or by using the <code>-v</code> flag of the Python interpreter, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>py -3 fish.py gcd.fish -v 111 87
</code></pre>

<p>This program uses the Euclidean algorithm. Here's a GIF I prepared earlier:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMVsN.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Note that >&lt;> is toroidal, so when the bottom left <code>v</code> instruction is executed the instruction pointer goes downwards, wraps around, and reappears at the top.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: By making the code run entirely from <strong>right to left</strong>, @randomra managed to shave three bytes with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;~@v!?:%}:{:

</code></pre>

<p>Guess I didn't golf it down enough :)</p>

<p>CoffeeScript began as a small project of jashkenas to learn how parsing does work. The <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/commit/8e9d637985d2dc9b44922076ad54ffef7fa8e9c2">first commit was on December 13, 2009 with the description "initial commit of the mystery language"</a>. On December 24, 2009, the first release, 0.1.0 was released. It was quite incomplete, and features were added in. 0.1.4 released a day after 0.1.0 changed assignment operator to <code>=</code> and fixed grammar quirks like <code>a(1)(2)(3)(4)</code> not working (PHP, take lessons). 0.1.5 added ranges.</p>

<p>0.2.0 (January 5, 2010) introduced the syntax that is more known today with significant whitespace. The syntax looked more like now.</p>

<p>0.5.0 (February 21, 2010) rewritten the compiler to be written in CoffeeScript. At this point, CoffeeScript got 300 hits on GitHub a day.</p>

<p>1.0.0 (December 24, 2010) the project was announced on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2037801">Hacker News</a>. The language was mostly stable at this point.</p>

<div id="pu93" class="pu"><h1>2014 - Swift</h1>

<p>Swift is a multi-paradigm language released by Apple in the summer of 2014, although Chris Lattner began work on it way back in 2010. Swift largely follows C syntax and borrows features from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C# and many other languages, such as closures, generics, protocols/interfaces, categories/extension methods, tuples, and non-nullability and immutability by default.</p>

<p>All these examples can be run at <a href="http://swiftstub.com/">SwiftStub</a>.</p>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

<pre><code>println("Swift was made in 2014!")
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 2</h2>

<p>Swift has flexible switch statements allowing constants, ranges and enums (which are intended to be algebraic types) allowing for fairly powerful pattern matching.</p>

<pre><code>func asciin(n:Int) -&gt; String {
    var r = 0;
    return [Int](0..&lt;n*n).reduce("", { msg, next in
        switch next % n {
            case 0, r: return msg + "N";
            case n-1: r++; return msg + "N\n";
            default: return msg + " ";
        }
    }
)}
</code></pre>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<p>Tuples make this easy, but because parameters are immutable we need to create a new mutable tuple from them.</p>

<pre><code>func gcd(a:Int, b:Int) -&gt; Int {
    var g = (a, b);
    while(g.1 &gt; 0) {
        g = (g.1, g.0 % g.1);
    }
    return g.0;
}

<div id="pu94" class="pu"><h1>2011 - Dart</h1>

<p>Dart is an Open Source programming language developed by Google which is developed as a replacement for Javascript (althought it compiles to javascript). It was unveiled by Google in 2011 during the GOTO conference.</p>

<h2>"Hello World!" Variant:</h2>

<pre><code>main() {
  print('Dart was made in 2011!');

<h2>ASCII Art N:</h2>

<p>Bruteforce method, runs at 0(n²), but it shouldn't really matter unless you use a giant number.</p>

<pre><code>asciiN(int number){
    if(number == 1){

                    currentLine = currentLine + "N";

<p><a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" rel="noreferrer">Snap<i>!</i></a> is a language based on <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" rel="noreferrer">Scratch</a>, made at Berkeley University. It is an upgrade to Scratch featuring first-class data and custom blocks (functions). Like Scratch, it is not text based, but rather done by visual &quot;blocks&quot; that snap together.</p>
<p>Snap<i>!</i>, written in JavaScript, is the successor to BYOB, which was written in Squeak Smalltalk. Snap<i>!</i> was beta released for public consumption in <a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/tree/0b510366d230399a38f18a8db92dd396a0dad42e" rel="noreferrer">March 2013</a>.</p>
<p>Snap<i>!</i> is actually not an esoteric language. It is used as the programming language for the <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/" rel="noreferrer">Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)</a> AP CS course at Berkeley and others.</p>
<p>I helped out with testing and stuff.</p>

<h2>ASCII Art &quot;N&quot;</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wxXLN.png" alt="enter image description here" /></p>
<p>This uses the stdlib for some of the blocks.</p>
<p>Pretty basic looping here. Takes an input. Then we just add it all together and say it (result for n=5):</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3B1I.png" alt="enter image description here" /></p>
<p>I took the liberty here to just use 2 spaces instead of 1, because Snap! doesn't say stuff in monospace.</p>
<h2>GCD</h2>
<p>The Euclidean algorithm isn't very fast, but it works, and is pretty simple. (Sorry, i made a typo in the block name. Now i closed the tab without saving. It'll just have to stay.)</p>
