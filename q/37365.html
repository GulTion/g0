Thank you for reading my memo. In other news, the */ function item (#12 in the list of things that have an asterisk before them) was discovered recently, which I read on a local news site.
#12 is my favorite function item! Just thought you'd be interested. Sorry if this is too off-topic; here's some business stuff. Imagine that you had some (let's say you have a combination of $10
&amp; $money) # of dollars (i.e. you have $10 + $money). Now, here's the important part. It's so important, I'll separate it from the rest of this message with the brackets I discovered:

{
#10 in my personal list of things to remember about money management is that you have to be careful. I still haven't been able to
sort #9 out yet (I bought the manual from someone else), but #9 also seems to be about being careful. You also have to guard the dollars
($money); #13 says that if you don't protect them by putting them in a bank or something, they might be stolen.

I hope I{qualify for this new function. I once again want to sincerely apologize for my earlier secret message.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work at this department instead.
I must admit it's hard to resist the urge to write code, but I'll do my best.

Thank you.

Works the same as the new 05AB1E version, though.)</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>05AB1E code ignores newlines and spaces outside of strings or compressed string/numbers (except when using the (if-)else-statement I just found out in an earlier attempt of making this program.. &gt;.&gt;), so let's do the same in this explanation.</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>DearBossâ€šIhope # These are all no-ops; they do execute, but won't affect the output:

  a            #  Check if these numbers are letters (becomes a list of 0s / falsey values)

of earning second in the national clown contest, it sure feels great to be on top for once. My clown
ASCII art could use some work, but hopefully I did a solid representation of our troupe. I can't believe
this was the one year you were sick, but we went and earned the $100k in your absence.

<p>Apparently my job is at a clown troupe that just won the grand prize, my boss's name is Isaq, and my signature didn't work and forgot to credit Charlie Chaplin.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> This was afwul. CJam throws an error on any character that isn't a command or whitespace, or when we try to take input but there isn't any, or you try to do a command but the stack's empty, etc. This means that <code>knruvxylqo</code> is unusable for the actual code (except the one <code>q</code> at the start to load in the array), and <code>emth</code> are also notably difficult. So of the famous rstlne from Wheel of Fortune, we have left... s. English is going to be hard. I'll be explaining what happens on each character, but not really why because there's so much to go through, especially with the clown. (also I don't know why a couple of the things work shh...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> I tried a few greetings to open us off (<code>Greetings</code>, <code>Hello</code>, etc.) and <code>Hi</code> was the only viable one. The others either threw errors or consumed input. <code>Hi</code> just pushes 17 and makes sure it's an int. The <code>;</code> then throws that 17 away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> <code>Isaq</code> gives us <code>[&quot;18&quot;]</code> by pushing 18, stringifying it, and putting it in an array. <code>q</code> then gives us our input array as a string.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> Row one of the clown: <code>\</code> swaps our two elements. <code>~</code> takes &quot;18&quot; out of the array. <code>O</code> pushes an empty string. <code>~</code> makes it disappear. <code>/</code> throws away &quot;18&quot; but puts our input string into an array.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> Row two: <code>(</code> takes our input out of the array, but leaves an empty string before it on the stack. <code>1</code> pushes 1. <code>)</code> increments that 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> Row three I brute-forced after writing row 5, because I knew kinda what I needed it to do. <code>@</code> rotates our array so the input is on bottom and empty string on top, <code>O</code> adds another empty string, and <code>@</code> rotates it so 2 is on top.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> Row four: <code>/</code> gets rid of the 2, <code>\</code> swaps the identical empty strings, and <code>*</code> gets rid of one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> Out of the clown now. The next <code>*</code> gets rid of our other empty string, leaving just the input string. Finally, we parse it into a bunch of numbers with <code>~</code>. <code>50 Times!</code> ends up just pushing a 50 and a 0 when all is said and done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> Now into the winnings block. <code>;;</code> gets rid of our 50 and 0. <code>WINNINGS</code> takes advantage of the fact that CJam doesn't yell at you if you scream at it because capital letters are variables. Unfortunately, that means it also pushes a bunch of junk. The next 8 <code>;</code>s take care of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> We're just back to our input numbers now. We'll use a not-so-sneaky <code>]</code> to turn them into an array and <code>$</code> to sort them. We just need to output with <code>p</code> now, but unfortunately for it to make sense we need some money first. We push <code>10000</code>, plus an <code>O</code> because we need two things for the upcoming semicolons to destroy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="spoiler">
<p> After a simple <code>p</code>, we've printed our sorted array! It's not much of a letter though. <code>1</code> and <code>is</code> are harmless. We start a quote with <code>&quot;</code>, then end it with <code>'</code> to let us write in English unimpeded. We do the inverse with a quote at the end to close up, and the <code>-</code>throws what we have left on the stack away so it doesn't automatically output. This way, it looks like we intended to attribute the quote, but forgot.</p>

"Shinsaibashi Tower" [Conference, `NOT FOR SHOPPING`]

`I will be coming back on Day 2, so the trip will not cost too much hopefully.

 2. Note the two missing hashes (comments). The first is far more obvious than the second.

 It parses as this: "fun = sort", and compiles to this: "var fun; fun = sort;"</p>

I feel the need to alert you to a pressing matter.
Nothing Dan from Marketing's head seems to be */function/*ing anymore.
I have a lot of evidence, but not enough time to */sort/* through it.
Should I just send it to you directly */(/*although I'm sure you have about a thou*/s/*and other things to do*/)/*?
Nah, here's it in a summary:

Dan seems to be overly facinated by the */{/* key on his keyboard, and presses it many times a minute.
He */return/*ed his new Galaxy */s/*4, after trying to eat it, multiple times.*/.

/*When Dan was tasked to */sort/* through the Haberson account, he attempted to stab his computer multiple times with a ruler */(/*he was eventually deterred by Jenny)
Everyone backed off for a few days, but we all remembered.
Later, we approached him about the incident, he claimed hostile working conditions and that he was unable to */function(/*.
I think he m*/a/*y need to see a psychatrist.

None of us feel safe to approach him on the topic again*/, b/*rining up conflict is something most of us like to avoid. (except Jenny*/)
{/*Dan was then moved to a different spot in the building, in an attempt to give him a new environment.
Despite the move he */return/*ed to his old desk every day, and wrote */a - b/* on the walls of the new spot.
We all just sort of accepted that and the layout planner gave up after a week or two.

One week we got a new employee in the office. When she went to say Hi to Dan, he screamed a - b over and over.
Not sure what his fascination is there. b-c is a much superior algorithm.

We're not really sure what caused this, but one day he switched from the { key to the */}
/*key. Dan switched back the next day.

There is an ongoing betting pool on what will happen next (general categories mostly*/)
/*Currently the betting for him stabbing an actual person is at almost $20,000.

Please do something about Dan. If anything start a reality TV show from the security tapes.

On a completely unrelated note, I love this new */}/* key, it's really neat looking. Did my keyboard always have this?
Sincerely,
Zeke*/

Dear Boss,

I  am writing    this Mail because     i want to discuss  
 the recent   incident.
I am Thankful    that you did not fire   me, and gave me a secretary position instead.
I dont have any    experience in being a     sec retary and I am not very. good at   writing mail,
so please   excuse any spelling,   grammar or   formating   errors  in     this mail.

I will       certainly     try to improve  and do   my best in my new job      and will'''
'from now on strictly ';exec'''ute your orders.   =
Firstly      i want to    sincerly        apologize my   dumb behaviour,it was  idiotic ( and childish ).
I   really  ;apologize  to you. it  wont  .happen again, sir. If   i   could  
 only   reverse   the  timeline       (to undo it all). Then i would;
I   really   promise to never  write  code in any form

Can i talk about that   in   a   meeting with  you?
  Maybe    today at'''[4::15]#in the afternoon?
