<p><code>1</code> is an edge case. <code>j</code> counts all positive integers <code>&gt;1</code>, then <code>j*prevprime(j+1)=j*p(n)</code> will always be a prime <code>p(n)</code> multiplied by <code>j</code> where <code>p(n+1)&gt;j&gt;=p(n)</code>. Thus, the prime factors of <code>j</code> will always be <code>&lt;=p(n)</code>, and so <code>p(n)</code> is never multiplied by a lone prime <code>&lt;p(n)</code> or <code>&gt;p(n)</code>. Additionally, each composite <code>j</code> is multiplied by a unique prime. Thus, there are no cases where any number is multiplied by more than one lone prime. Similar idea works with <code>nextprime(j-1)</code>.</p>

<p>Not the shortest, not the fastest, but it does (partially) answer the additional math problems.</p>
<p>First we'll make some definitions to facilitate the proof of why this algorithm works. For any <span class="math-container">\$i \in \mathbb{N}\$</span> let <span class="math-container">\$S_i\$</span> be the sequence <span class="math-container">\$i,2i,3i,5i,\dots\$</span> that is, all numbers which are a product of <span class="math-container">\$i\$</span> and a prime or 1. We are looking to generate a sequence <span class="math-container">\$A\$</span> such that for all <span class="math-container">\$i \in \mathbb{N}\$</span> we have that <span class="math-container">\$|A \cap S_i|=1\$</span>.</p>
<p>We construct our desired sequence as follows. We begin with an empty sequence, we then count up through all <span class="math-container">\$i \in \mathbb{N}\$</span>, and at each step if we already have an element from <span class="math-container">\$S_i\$</span> in the sequence we do nothing, if we don't then we add <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i\$</span> to the sequence, where <span class="math-container">\$p_i\$</span> is the <span class="math-container">\$i^{th}\$</span> prime number. It should be clear why this method will construct a sequence with at least one element from each <span class="math-container">\$S_i\$</span>, but we also need to show that it does not have more than one element from any <span class="math-container">\$S_i\$</span>. To show this we demonstrate the following two properties of <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i\$</span>.</p>
<p>First, <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i \not \in S_j\$</span> for all <span class="math-container">\$j&lt;i\$</span>. This must be the case since if <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i \in S_j\$</span> for some <span class="math-container">\$j&lt;i\$</span> that would imply that <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i= q \cdot a \cdot p_i\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$q\$</span> is prime (or 1) and <span class="math-container">\$a \cdot p_i = j\$</span> but this is a contradiction since <span class="math-container">\$p_i &gt; i &gt; j\$</span></p>
<p>Second there can exist no <span class="math-container">\$j,k\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$j&lt;i&lt;k\$</span> such that <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i \in S_k\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$j \cdot p_j \in S_k\$</span>. This must also be true, since if there exist some <span class="math-container">\$j,k\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$j&lt;i&lt;k\$</span> such that <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i \in S_k\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$j \cdot p_j \in S_k\$</span> that would imply that <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i= q \cdot a \cdot p_i\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$q\$</span> is prime (or 1) and <span class="math-container">\$a \cdot p_i = k\$</span> and that <span class="math-container">\$j \cdot p_j= r \cdot b \cdot p_j\$</span> where <span class="math-container">\$r\$</span> is prime (or 1) and <span class="math-container">\$b \cdot p_j = k\$</span>. This would mean that <span class="math-container">\$a \cdot p_i = b \cdot p_j\$</span>, and further that <span class="math-container">\$p_i\$</span> is a factor of <span class="math-container">\$b \cdot p_j\$</span>, but this cannot be the case, since <span class="math-container">\$p_i &gt; p_j\$</span> and <span class="math-container">\$p_i &gt; i&gt;j \geq b\$</span>.</p>
<p>With these two properties we have shown that our sequence will never have more than one element from any <span class="math-container">\$S_i\$</span> since that would require adding an element to the sequence which is in a common <span class="math-container">\$S_i\$</span> with an element already in the sequence, which would require one of the above properties to be false.</p>
<p>So what about the answers to the additional math problems? Well if we look back through the proof we'll note that there's nothing particularly special about adding <span class="math-container">\$i \cdot p_i \$</span>. In fact we should be able to choose any prime in place of <span class="math-container">\$p_i\$</span> so long as it is greater than <span class="math-container">\$i\$</span> and greater than the last prime we chose. This means that since there are infinite primes, we have infinite choices for what number to add each time we add a number to the sequence. Specifically, we make a countably infinite number of choices each with a countably infinite number of valid options, meaning we can construct an uncountably infinite number of valid sequences in this way. Note that this method is not exhaustive, and there are valid sequences which cannot be constructed in this way as well.</p>
<p>As for the second question, since the natural density of the primes is 0, any valid sequence constructed using the method described here will also have a natural density of 0 since the sequence will be more sparse than the primes by the nature of the construction.</p>
