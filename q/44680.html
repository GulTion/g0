<div id="pu0" class="pu"><h1>GNU Sed</h1>
<p>I am self-imposing a more restrictive requirement - all snippets will be complete <code>sed</code> programs.</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p><code>sed</code> <em>is</em> a Turing-complete language. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150217125442/http://robertkotcher.com/sed.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is a proof.</a></p>
<h3>Length 0 Snippet</h3>
<p>I don't think a length 0 snippet is strictly required, but since it actually does something in sed, here it is:</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Sed is the &quot;Stream EDitor&quot;, i.e. it reads the stream (line-by-line) from STDIN, edits, then outputs to STDOUT. The zero-length sed program simply copies STDIN to STDOUT. Thus the <code>cat</code> utility may be emulated by sed. The following are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>cat a.txt b.txt &gt; c.txt
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>sed '' a.txt b.txt &gt; c.txt
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>=
</code></pre>
<p>This sed program prints the line number of each line to STDOUT. This is approximately equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>nl
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>cat -n
</code></pre>
<p>although the sed version puts the line number on its own line.</p>
<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>5q
</code></pre>
<p>Copies STDIN to STOUT and <code>q</code>uits after line 5. This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>head -n5
</code></pre>
<p>You might be starting to see a bit of a pattern here - <code>sed</code> can be used to emulate many of the standard coreutils tools.</p>
<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>iHi
</code></pre>
<p><code>i</code>nserts &quot;Hi\n&quot; before every line. Meh.</p>
<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>/a/d
</code></pre>
<p>A lot of sed's power is in its regex capability. This program causes all lines matching the regex <code>a</code> to be <code>d</code>eleted from the stream. All other lines will still be output to STDOUT. This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>grep -v &quot;a&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>:l;bl
</code></pre>
<p>This is an infinite loop. We all love CPU-hogging infinite loops. Defines a label <code>l</code>, then <code>b</code>ranches (jumps) to it. Ad infinitum.</p>
<h3>Length 6 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>N;/a/d
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>N</code> command is very useful when you want information on lines <code>N</code>ext to what you're looking for; it appends an extra line to the pattern space. This will remove any pair of lines (starting from the first line) that match a regex <code>a</code></p>
<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>s/a/A/g
</code></pre>
<p>By default, sed applies <code>s</code> commands such that it will match just the first occurrence on each line. If you need it to match (and substitute) every occurrence on a line, then the <code>g</code> flag at the end of the <code>s</code> command will do this.</p>
<h3>Length 8 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>y/01/10/
</code></pre>
<p>The little used <code>y</code> command is similar to the <code>tr</code> shell utility (though not quite as flexible). This program will switch all <code>0</code>s with <code>1</code>s and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Length 9 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1!G;$p;h
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet is 8 bytes, but requires the -n parameter for sed to suppress default output. As per standard code-golf rules, I'm counting this as 9. This uses something called the 'hold space', which is essentailly a place to store something you want later. <code>1!</code> means 'on every line but the first', <code>G</code> appends the hold space to the pattern space, <code>$p</code> means <code>p</code>rint when on the last line, and <code>h</code> replaces the hold space with the current pattern space for us to <code>G</code>rab on the next cycle. So:</p>
<pre><code>sed -n '1!G;$p;h'
</code></pre>
<p>is exactly equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>tac
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 10 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>s/[ &lt;TAB&gt;]+$//
</code></pre>
<p>This is a revisit of the (old) length 6 snippet. This strips trailing whitespace (spaces and TABs) from lines.</p>
<h3>Length 11 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed -n '/a/{N;N;p}'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>{</code> command does exactly what you think it does: it groups a bunch of commands together until there's a <code>}</code>. As with most commands, you can restrict it to a range or a regex; so this program will <code>p</code>rint lines containing regex <code>a</code> along with the two <code>N</code>ext lines following them.</p>
<h3>Length 12 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'1,4d;9,/^$/d'
</code></pre>
<p>Speaking of restricting to ranges or regex, you can even do both at the same time. The first command <code>d</code>eletes lines 1-4 (counting the 1st line as line 1) and the second <code>d</code>eletes line 9, and then continues deleting until (and including) it hits an empty line.</p>
<h3>Length 13 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'/i/,/a/s/a/A/'
</code></pre>
<p>(Read '/i/,/a/' as a range and then 's/a/A/' as the commnad) If you start a range with a regex, sed will start a new range each time you hit that regex. This capitilizes the first <code>a</code> after each line with an i. (it also capitalizes the first a on the same line as an <code>i</code>, if there is one; the second address is not checked until the range starts)</p>
<h3>Length 14 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>:l;N;$!bl;p;p;
</code></pre>
<p>The fisrt bit loads the entire input into the pattern space: define label <code>l</code>, add a line to pattern space, <code>b</code>ranch to <code>l</code> if we're not(<code>!</code>) the last line(<code>$</code>). In total, this program <code>p</code>rints the entire input three times: once for each <code>p</code>, and then again at the end with the default output.</p>
<h3>Length 15 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'/a/,+9d;/i/,~5d'
</code></pre>
<p>GNU Sed adds some interesting ranging options in addition to the earlier ones. <code>,+#</code> will match <code>#</code> lines following the first address and <code>,~#</code> will continue to match until the line number is divisible by <code>#</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 16 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'5,10w output.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>'r insertfile.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>Sed has a way to act directly on files with a command option (<code>-i</code> for edit-<code>i</code>n-place, with an optional backup file using <code>-i.bak</code> or whatever other suffix you want to add) but you can technically read and write to files inside your script. However, be careful when using them; <code>r</code>, for example, will output the entire file at the end of each cycle rather than appending it to the input as you may expect it to. To do this, just give each file name as another command line option like:</p>
<h3>Length 17 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed -s '1F' in.txt file.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-s</code> command lets you treat each added file as an entirely new group of lines, starting the line count over and reseting your ranges. This script, for example, will print the current <code>F</code>ilename whenever it hits the first line of a file, allowing you to see where one file ends and the next begins.</p>
<h3>Length 18 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'N;N;P;D;P#comments'
</code></pre>
<p>Sed is pretty small in terms of built in commands, so we've almost covered everything. Several commands have a uppercase version which does things one line at a time for when you decide to load more lines into the pattern space with <code>N</code>: <code>P</code>rint up to first newline, <code>D</code>elete up to the first newline, etc. This is also a good a time as any to mention <code>#</code> makes the rest of the line into a comment, and will not be executed.</p>
<h3>Length 18 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed ':l;N;$!bl;e' srpt.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Coming full circle to rendering other commands in sed, this is roughly the same as <code>sh srpt.sh</code>. The first bit we talked about earlier, loading the full input into the pattern space; and the <code>e</code>xecute command runs the pattern space as a bash script and replaces the pattern space with the resulting output. In this example that means it just prints with the standard end-of-cycle output. You can disable <code>e</code>, as well as <code>r</code> and <code>w</code>, with the <code>--sandbox</code> command line option.</p>
<h3>Length 19 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed '/\\\//,//s///g' --debug
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--debug</code> option is a great help whenever sed does something completely unexpected, as it shows each step sed takes in each cycle. It tells you, for each cycle: where the input is coming from, the new pattern space, the hold space if there is any, each command that is run with the results of that command, and the end of cycle output. It also renders your sed program in a more readable multiline form at the very start.</p>
<p>In this case, what happens is that an empty regex <code>//</code> is replaced with the most recently used regex when an empty regex wouldn't make sense. Since ranges are active whenever they are open, this is the same as just doing <code>'s/\\\///'</code>; ie it <code>s</code>waps each <code>\/</code> with an empty string.a</p>
<h3>Length 20 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed -nE 's/(a|b{2})/\u\1/gp'
</code></pre>
<p>The last thing I want to mention is the <code>-E</code> extended regex option, and a few fancy things on the <code>s</code>wap command. <code>-E</code> allows you to use characters for their regex meaning rather than their literal meaning. There are also many 'backslash escapes' you can incorperate into your replace string; used here are <code>\u</code> for 'next letter uppercase' and <code>\1</code> for 'first capture group'. Finally, many standalone commands have a 'flag version' that work at the end of a <code>s</code>wap statement, like the <code>p</code> which prints if there was a successful swap.</p>

<div id="pu1" class="pu"><h1>APL</h1>
<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>APL (<strong>A</strong> <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>L</strong>anguage) started out as an interpreter for a formula notation devised by <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ken Iverson</a>. When the language was designed, people used teletypwriters to communicate with computers. The character set of these was limited, but due to their construction, one could put multiple characters into the same position to compose complex characters. This feature is heavily used by APL, contributing to its infamous reputation as a read-only language.</p>
<p>You can try out most of the examples on <a href="http://www.tryapl.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.tryapl.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Length 1</h2>
<pre><code>⍝
</code></pre>
<p>The character <code>⍝</code>, called lampshade, both for its shape and for the enlightment you get from its presence, introduces a comment. Historically, it was created by overstriking a <code>∘</code> (jot) and a <code>∩</code> (up shoe).</p>
<h2>Length 2</h2>
<pre><code>⍳3
</code></pre>
<p>The monadic (one argument) function <code>⍳</code> (iota) generates a vector of the first few natural numbers. For instance, the aforementioned <code>⍳3</code> would yield <code>1 2 3</code>, the vector of the first three natural numbers. On some implementations of APL, it would yield <code>0 1 2</code> instead, this depends on the value of <code>⎕IO</code>, the <strong>i</strong>ota <strong>o</strong>rigin.</p>
<h2>Length 3</h2>
<pre><code>5\3
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to the monadic <code>⍳</code>, the dyadic <code>\</code> (expand) function copies the argument on the right as often as the argument on the left; thus, <code>5\3</code> yields <code>3 3 3 3 3</code>. You might want to play around with vector arguments (like <code>1 2 3\4 5 6</code>) to see what it does then.</p>
<h2>Length 4</h2>
<pre><code>A←⍳3
</code></pre>
<p>This assigns to <code>A</code> the value of <code>⍳3</code>. <code>←</code> (left arrow) is the assignment operator. An assignment doesn't have to be the leftmost thing in a statement; assignments are parsed like function calls and yield the assigned value for further use.</p>

<pre><code>∘.×⍨A
</code></pre>
<p>A three by three multiplication table, that is,</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
</code></pre>
<p>This is a little bit complicated, so let me explain. <code>⍺∘.f⍵</code> (read: alpha jot dot f omega) is the <em>outer product</em> of <code>⍺</code> and <code>⍵</code> over <code>f</code>. The outer product is a table of the result of applying <code>f</code> to each possible pair of elements from <code>⍺</code> and <code>⍵</code>. In this example, <code>f</code> is <code>×</code> (multiply), yielding a multiplication table. The operator <code>⍨</code> (tilde diæresis) <em>commutes</em>  its arguments, that is, <code>⍺f⍨⍵</code> is equal to <code>⍺f⍵</code> and <code>f⍨⍵</code> without a left operand is equal to <code>⍵f⍵</code>. Without the commute operator this snippet would be <code>A∘.×A</code>. The outer product operator is very versatile; check out what happens if you substitute <code>=</code> for <code>×</code>!</p>
<h2>Length 6</h2>
<pre><code>{×/⍳⍵}
</code></pre>
<p>A factorial function. A pair of curly braces encloses a <em>dfn</em> (dynamic function), that is, an anonymous function (cf. lambda expressions). The arguments to a dfn are bound to the variables <code>⍺</code> and <code>⍵</code> or just <code>⍵</code> if the dfn is called as a monadic (single argument, as opposed to dyadic, two argument) function. We apply <code>⍳</code> to the right argument, yielding integers from <code>1</code> to <code>⍵</code>. The <code>/</code> (slash) operator reduces, that is <code>f/⍵</code> inserts <code>f</code> between the items of <code>⍵</code>. For instance, <code>+/⍳5</code> is just <code>1+2+3+4+5</code>. In this case, we reduce with <code>×</code>, yielding the product of the items of <code>⍳⍵</code>, which is just the factorial of <code>⍵</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 7</h2>
<pre><code>2×3*4+5
</code></pre>
<p>Yields <code>39366</code>. <code>⍺*⍵</code> (alpha star omega) is <code>⍺</code> raised to the power of <code>⍵</code>. APL has a very simple precedence rule: Everything is evaluated from right to left, all functions are right-associative. Operators bind stronger than functions and are evaluates from left to right. Thus, the expression above with explicit parentheses would be written as <code>2×(3*(4+5))</code> as opposed to the usual <code>(2×(3*4))+5</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 8</h2>
<pre><code>¯1+3 3⍴A
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet yields</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2
0 1 2
0 1 2
</code></pre>
<p>and demonstrates two important concepts: The first concept is the <code>⍴</code> (rho) function, which <em>reshapes</em> its right argument to the shape specified in its left argument. The shape of an array is a vector of the lengths of each axis in the array. The shape of a scalar is the empty vector. Thus, <code>3 3⍴A</code> reshapes <code>A</code> into a three by three matrix. The second concept is how addition is used here: We add <code>¯1</code> (overbar one), meaning negative one (<code>¯</code> is a prefix to specify negative numbers, while <code>-</code> is an operator) to an array. The two operands have different shapes, so the operand with the lesser shape is distributed onto the other operand, subtracting one from every item in the generated matrix.</p>
<h2>Length 9</h2>
<pre><code>+.×⍨3 3⍴A
</code></pre>
<p><code>A</code>, reshaped to a 3 by 3 matrix, multiplied with itself. The <code>.</code> (dot) operator takes two functions and constructs an <em>inner product</em>, where the first function represents <em>addition</em> and the second function <em>multiplication.</em> A plain, old, matrix multiplication is <code>+.×</code>, a common variant is <code>≠.∧</code> (where <code>≠</code> is not equal and <code>∧</code> (up caret) is logical and) for boolean matrices; many interesting things can be modelled as an inner product with certain operators in place of <code>+</code> and <code>×</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 10</h2>
<pre><code>(.5×⊢+÷)⍣≡
</code></pre>
<p>(read: left parenthesis dot five multiply right-tack plus divide right parenthesis star-diæresis same) Compute the square root of a real using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Babylonian method</a>. The left argument is the number you want to compute the square root of, the right argument is the initial guess for the square root. I originally wanted to provide a meaningful initial guess, but I ran out of characters (append <code>⍨</code> to use the number itself as the initial guess).</p>
<p>So how does this work? Let's start with the left part, <code>(.5×⊢+÷)</code>, first. This expression uses tacit notation originating in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44684/26997">J</a> which was later ported back to Dyalog APL. Tacit notation is a bit hard for beginners, so please read this section carefully. An isolated sequence, such as <code>+/÷≢</code>, which the “normal” parsing rules do not resolve to a single part of speech is called a train. A train of two or three functions produces a function and (by repeated resolution), a function train of any length also produces a function. A train of three functions <code>fgh</code> behaves like <code>{(⍺f⍵)g⍺h⍵}</code>, that is, <code>f</code> and <code>h</code> are applied to the arguments of the resulting function and the result of these are applied to <code>g</code>. A train of an array and two functions like <code>Afg</code> behaves like <code>{Af⍺g⍵}</code>, this is, <code>g</code> is applied to the arguments of the resulting function and <code>A</code> and that result are applied to <code>f</code>. A train of two functions has a semantic, too, which is explained in the documentation but not used in this example.</p>
<p>In this particular train, one new function, <code>⊢</code> (right tack) is used. It behaves like <code>{⍵}</code>, yielding its right argument. Thus, the entire expression is equal to <code>{.5×⍵+⍺÷⍵}</code>, which is just the iteration step of the Babylonian formula. It is easy to see how tacit notation benefits the golfer; it allows you to shave of quite a few precious characters where applicable.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the <code>⍣</code> (star diæresis), <em>power</em> operator. If the right argument is an array, <code>f⍣A⍵</code> applies <code>f</code> to <code>⍵</code> a total of <code>A</code> times. For instance, <code>f⍣3⍵</code> is equal to <code>fff⍵</code>. The count can be negative, in which case APL tries to infer an inverse function of <code>f</code> and applies that. If the right argument to <code>⍣</code> is a function, too, <code>f⍣g⍵</code> applies <code>f</code> to <code>⍵</code> until <code>(fY)gY</code> where <code>Y</code> is the result of the repeated application of <code>f</code> to <code>⍵</code>. Notably, if <code>g</code> is <code>=</code> (equal) or <code>≡</code> (same), <code>f⍣≡</code> computes a <em>fix point</em> of <code>f</code>. This is exactly what we need for the Babylonian method! We want to iterate until the result converges. Lastly, if <code>⍣</code> applied to a pair of things is invoked as a dyadic function, the left argument is bound to <code>f</code> on the left, i.e. <code>⍺f⍣g⍵</code> is equal to <code>(⍺∘f)⍣g⍵</code> where <code>A∘f</code> behaves like <code>{Af⍵}</code>.</p>

<div id="pu2" class="pu"><h2><strong><a href="http://www.ptc.com/products/mathcad/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mathcad</a></strong></h2>
<p>Well, this is not my favourite language, but this definitely hasn't been covered here, and it looks like a great golfing lang to me!
To those blissed to not know what it is: Mathcad is sort of like a simplified Matlab, but clunkier. It has existed since 1986, and it is one of the oldest software products of its kind.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Mathcad is a purely-procedural programming language with type inference and a really, really weird editor: each operator is added to the program by a keyboard key or combination of keys, but gets displayed on-screen as a (sometimes quite long) keyword.</p>
<p>Oh, and it doesn't support spaces, except in strings. And no tabs or linebreaks. Even if you have a very long line of code. Yes, Mathcad is weird.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>
<p>Here's a simple program in Mathcad:</p>
<p><code>a</code></p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid program. It declares a (global) variable <code>a</code>. Mathcad doesn't have any constants. And, since it uses type inference, this variable can become anything Mathcad can make it, from an integer to a matrix. Cool, huh?</p>
<p>Interesting fact: I call it a &quot;variable&quot;, but, theoretically, Mathcad does not have any global variables, only <em>redefinable global constants</em> that can be <em>redefined</em> to have a new value, albeit only in global scope.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact: that thing is also a function. I'll explain it later. Just believe me for now.</p>
<p>And yes, this declaration is completely, totally useless. You can even say this causes problems as it limits the key shortcuts we can use if we decide to define it in another statement.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>
<p>Here's another simple valid program in Mathcad:</p>
<p><code>a'</code> (equivalent to <code>'a</code>)</p>
<p>Formatted as <code>(a)</code></p>
<p>What does this do? This takes our newly declared <code>a</code> into parentheses! This doesn't do anything really, but is still valid code, too. Parentheses in Mathcad are normally used in arithmetical expressions.</p>
<p>I hope you're beginning to see the sheer weirdness of Mathcad. An apostrophe as a shortcut for parentheses? Who could have ever guessed it? By the way, we will get the same thing if we just type in <code>(a)</code>. But be warned, if you haven't typed in an opening parentheses before <code>a</code> first, no closing one allowed! Why? No idea...</p>
<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>
<p>Time for some <em>real</em> stuff! We can do (global) variable assignment now!
<code>a:1</code> (equivalent to <code>a=1</code> in this case)
Formatted as <code>a:=1</code></p>
<p>We've assigned the value <code>1</code> to our &quot;global variable&quot;, making its type a (signed, no unsigned types in Mathcad) integer. Or, speaking with Mathcad's terms, we &quot;defined the global constant <code>a</code>&quot;. As <code>a</code> wasn't defined before, <code>=</code> maps to global variable assignment as well as <code>:</code> (this won't work if <code>a</code> has been already defined <em>or</em> simply declared). Funny thing: the type is limited to the range of... <code>[-999999999999999, 999999999999999]</code>. Although Mathcad &quot;boasts&quot; calculations on numbers with as long as 17 decimal places, in reality, it will work without error with 15-decimal-place integers maximum even with peak settings (at least on my copy of Mathcad 15). Why does it even count them by decimal places? I can only guess...</p>
<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>
<p>Now, some functions!</p>
<p><code>b(c)</code> (finally something formatted just as typed)</p>
<p>This is a valid piece of code that is actually a function declaration, something like a C function prototype. It declares a function <code>b</code> with one parameter, <code>c</code>. Note that you can't leave the parameter list between the parentheses empty.</p>
<p>Why? Well, the proper Mathcad syntaxis for a 'void'-parameter function is actually... to omit the parentheses. Yep, exactly the same as declaring a &quot;global variable&quot;. In Mathcad, every &quot;global variable&quot; is sort of like a parameterless function that always returns one thing - the value it was initialized to by a definition or a redefinition. I'll demonstrate it later.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and functions can be redefined, just like variables. However, Mathcad has no overloading, so the function called will always be the last one declared. How very, <em>very</em> handy.</p>
<p>Funny thing about our little function declaration: it is just as useless as a &quot;global variable&quot; declaration. It won't allow us to call itself, it won't allow us to use it to call a function with the same signature that will be added later. It will just sit there and be 100% syntactically correct.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>
<p>Let's do something fun with our functions!</p>
<p><code>c:b{1</code> (formatted as <code>c := b ← 1</code>)</p>
<p>Note that this definition raises a warning about redefining a built-in Mathcad unit. Yes, Mathcad is one of those languages that sport a standart library built in right into the language, just like PHP. <code>c</code> is internally defined as a &quot;meters-per-second-speed-floating-point&quot; type variable approximating the speed of light.</p>
<p>So what does our definition do? Nothing important, actually. It is a parameterless function that does one thing: define a local variable b, initialize it to 1, and return the result of the expression, which is also 1.</p>
<p>Actually, Mathcad has an explicit <code>return</code> operator, but it not always needed: Mathcad will return the last thing it sees in the function if it doesn't see the <code>return</code>. Period. Be it a value, a variable, or the result of an expression, it will be returned.</p>
<p>Another funny note: local function variables can have default values if a &quot;constant&quot; of the same name has been declared in the global scope. You can change the local variable's value, but you cannot change its global scope counterpart's value. So yeah, in that sense, Mathcad's &quot;global variables&quot; could be called &quot;constants&quot; (although I think that &quot;weird crap&quot; describes them much better than either of these). So, no shared function state. That's sad since Mathcad gives us no multithreading capabilities to compensate for that.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>
<p>Still not enough space for making a multi-expression function, so let's play with some ranges instead! Also, it's a good time to finally reach (numeric) evaluation.</p>
<p><code>0,2;9=</code> (formatted as <code>0,2 .. 9 = </code>)</p>
<p>This is a standalone expression that defines a range from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> inclusively with a <code>2 - 0 = 2</code> step.</p>
<p>The operator basically works like this: <code>range-start {optional: , range-start + range-step} ; range-end</code></p>
<p>It is then <em>evaluated numerically</em> by the <code>=</code> operator. In Mathcad, &quot;evaluate&quot; = &quot;output&quot;. In this case, it outputs a (vertical) table of all the elements of this range, which are, in this case: <code>0 2 4 6 8</code>.
If you remove <code>,2</code>, the step will default to <code>1</code>, giving you 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>
<p>Ah, finally, &quot;linebreaks&quot; in functions!</p>
<p><code>a:b{1]2</code></p>
<p>Formatted as:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MEw3P.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is a function that takes no parameters and returns... 2. This demonstrates two things: Mathcad's idiotic &quot;line breaks&quot; and its weird and almost completely useless &quot;sequence-point subblock&quot; construct.</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, this is what Mathcad gives us instead of line breaks. <code>]</code> means &quot;add line after last value, symbol, block in parentheses or empty line&quot;. So, if you want to write an expression on one line and another expression on the next line, you have to <em>first</em> prepare a line for the second expression, and <em>then</em> write the first expression. Otherwise, the last part of your expression ends up in its own small &quot;sequence-point&quot; sub-block. This can be a terrible pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Why do I call it a &quot;sequence-point subblock&quot;? Because it is basically the same as the old <strong>C</strong> parentheses-and-commas sequence-point construct: <code>(expr1, expr2, ..., exprn)</code>. To those of you who do not know what this is: it evaluates all the comma-separated expressions in order and returns the last one. The subblock above does exactly the same: it evaluates the expressions on each line in order and gives out the result of the last one. Yes, this could theoretically be useful in structuring a function. Probably.</p>
<p>By the way, the &quot;sequence-point subblock&quot; can also be used in global context. Just type in a value/symbol/block in parentheses and hit <code>]</code>, then the next one, etc., and when you're done, hit <code>=</code> to get the last value. This can be useful in... um... oh, I give up, it's also totally useless.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>
<p>And here's how you get an expression per line in Mathcad:</p>
<p><code>a:]b↑b{1</code> (from here on, I'll use the arrow symbols in place of the arrow keys).</p>
<p>Formatted as:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q0wQN.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is a parameterless function that assigns 1 to b and then returns it.</p>
<p>I think this needs a little explanation. First, we create our function with <code>a:</code>. Then, we add a new line to it with <code>]</code>. The cursor automatically travels to the added line, so we type <code>b</code> there, then use the up-arrow key to return to the previous line, and there initialize <code>b</code> to one.</p>
<p>Of course, this is golfed. In Mathcad, it is easier to add as much lines in advance as you might need, then move your cursor to the first one with the mouse and start typing your expressions, hitting the right-arrow key every time you need to go to the next line. <code>*insert facepalm here*</code></p>

<p>The program is stored in a sub-stack in <code>IS</code>, the built-in instruction stack; so in this case <code>IS</code> stores <code>[[]]</code>. The sub-stack is popped since it doesn't contain any instructions, and the program then terminates since <code>IS</code> is empty.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/DMYMAIG8J" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>This is the shortest infinite loop in [min]mod, and one of the shortest valid non-empty programs.</p>
<p>Since the instruction stack is a variable, it can be executed like any other. In this case, the value of the instruction stack will initially be <code>[[IS]]</code>. The program will try to execute the first instruction in <code>IS</code>, which is <code>IS</code> itself, by pushing its contents onto <code>IS</code> as a new sub-stack. At principally the same time, it pops that instruction from <code>IS</code>, making <code>IS</code> now contain <code>[[[IS]] []]]</code>.</p>
<p>Since the first instruction in the first sub-stack in <code>IS</code> is now a stack, it will be popped. Simultaneously, its contents are pushed as a new sub-stack, making <code>IS</code> contain <code>[[IS] [] []]</code>. Now, <code>IS</code> will be executed again, grow, be executed again, grow, and so on forever (assuming the computer has infinite memory).</p>

<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/YEeoHdZfR" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>Unlike the length 1 snippet, this won't throw an error since it won't actually execute <code>A</code>. The number of periods after an instruction determines its <em>indirection level</em>. An instruction or sub-stack with an indirection level of 0 will be executed, but with an indirection level of one or more, the instruction or sub-stack will instead be pushes onto the data stack, or the <code>DS</code>, which is another built-in variable.</p>
<p>The instruction pushed onto the data stack will have an indirection level one lower than the one executed, so <code>A..</code> pushes <code>A.</code> onto the data stack.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/TniUB3OcN" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>Since the program itself is a stack (or, rather, a sub-stack of the instruction stack), one might expect <code>B</code> to be pushed first, since it's presumably the top element of the stack. That's not true, however, since the program stack and its sub-stacks are reversed before being pushed onto <code>IS</code> for that exact reason: it's difficult to write code backwards. In other words, the above program pushes <code>A</code>, <em>then</em> <code>B</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 5 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>[].IF

<p>This program first <code>[]</code> is pushed onto the data stack. Then, the built-in variable <code>IF</code> is executed. <code>IF</code> contains a special magic instruction that pops once from the data stack, then once more if the first element was an empty stack (or a variable whose value is an empty stack). Here, the stack <em>is</em> empty, but there's no elements left to pop after it's gone, so the program will throw an error.</p>

<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/KeHirN3ya" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>This program pushes <code>B</code> and <code>A</code> onto <code>DS</code> before executing the <code>SET</code> instruction, which sets the top element of <code>DS</code> to the second element from the top.

<p>After pushing <code>IS</code> onto <code>DS</code>, the built-in <code>UNWRAP</code> instruction will replace <code>IS</code> with a reference to its value. This means that if the current value of <code>IS</code> changes, so will the stack reference in <code>DS</code>. If <code>IS</code> is reinitialized by the <code>SET</code> instruction, however, the stack reference in <code>DS</code> will still refer to the previous value.</p>

<p>The built-in variables that makes sense to execute aren't defined as magic instructions, but rather as stacks <em>containing</em> magic instructions.

<div id="pu5" class="pu"><h1>Awk</h1>
<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>Awk is a pithy programming language oriented toward string manipulation that also happens to be part of the POSIX standard set of utilities. Awk is named after its original authors, Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. Awk is often used in a pipeline, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128221202/https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?doi=bc9360202eee91cc204b44345f7903310b94f983" rel="nofollow noreferrer">large programs have been written in it</a> (pdf, 127KB), too.</p>
<h2>0 Characters</h2>
<p>Nothing in life is free: an empty awk program prints nothing and exits successfully. (And seems to be the only awk program that doesn't read standard input.)</p>
<h2>1 Character</h2>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>An awk program consists of patterns and actions. Omit the action and awk assumes <code>{ print }</code>. The above pattern is always true, so <code>awk</code> behaves exactly like <code>cat</code>.</p>
<p>Divergence: Some versions of <code>awk</code>, such as <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Ebwk/btl.mirror/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Kernighan's One True Awk</a> consider both the empty string input and the always-true pattern illegal. <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/awk.html#tag_04_06_13_01" rel="nofollow noreferrer">POSIX says</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either the pattern or the action (including the enclosing brace characters) can be omitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it comes down to whether or not <code>1</code> can be considered a pattern.</p>
<p>I'll try to rationalize the divergence between different versions of awk as long as I get more upvotes.</p>
<h2>2 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>$3
</code></pre>
<p>The above pattern is true if the third field has value. If it does, awk will print the whole line. Thus, as a whole awk program, the above will filter all lines that have fewer than three fields.</p>
<p>Once again, the One True Awk does not consider <code>$3</code> a pattern.</p>
<h2>3 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>int
</code></pre>
<p>BSD treats the above as <code>int($0)</code> and prints every line that can evaluate to a nonzero integer.</p>
<p>Most other awks I tried, including GNU awk consider this invalid. POSIX categorizes <code>int</code> as an <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/awk.html#tag_04_06_13_12" rel="nofollow noreferrer">arithmetic function</a> and says what it does when invoked without parentheses is undefined.</p>
<h2>4 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>NF&lt;4
</code></pre>
<p>This pattern causes Awk to print those records that have fewer than four fields in them. All editions of awk I tested behave consistently.</p>
<h2>5 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>/foo/
</code></pre>
<p>Boring though it may be, it's time to introduce actual regular expressions. This one will match any line containing the string <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code>. This is Awk's bread and butter, and also why it's fairly unnecessary to combine awk and grep.</p>
<h2>6 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>$NF=NR
</code></pre>
<p>This expression overloads the assignment operator <code>=</code> and assigns the number of the current record (row) to the last field. Treating assignments as booleans has the same caveats you might expect from another language. For example <code>$NF=NF</code> would set the last field value to the number of fields, but would skip empty rows.</p>
<h2>7 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>!(NR%2)
</code></pre>
<p>Will print out every other row. It will print the odd ones. I could have written <code>NR%2==0</code> in the same number of characters, which is more flexible because I could also write <code>NR%2==1</code> to get the complementary set of rows. I just picked the most obscure syntax because code golf.</p>
<h2>8 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>!s[$0]++
</code></pre>
<p>is one of my favorite Awk expressions. The first time it sees a line it prints it. It never prints the same series of characters again. It's the tersest stable, sort-free <code>uniq</code> I know.</p>
<h2>9 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>{print$3}
</code></pre>
<p>Print the third column. This is one of those boring, but important, Awk &quot;fundamentals&quot; that hopefully opens the door for cooler things with more characters. It's also our first <em>action</em>. (Remember from <em>1 Character</em> that Awk programs are made up of series of patterns and actions.) Everything heretofore has been just patterns.</p>
<h2>13 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>FNR&lt;3{print}
</code></pre>
<p>Prints the top 2 lines of each file argument.  Obviously the <code>print</code> command is redundant, but there were already examples of shorter code. <code>FNR</code> is the line/record number of the current file; whereas <code>NR</code> represents the total number of lines/records processed from all files.</p>
<h2>14 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>BEGIN{FS=&quot;,&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>BEGIN</code> pattern is true before any files have been processed. <code>FS</code> is the field separator pattern used to divide a line/record into fields. This line assigns the field separator before the first file is processed.  It is equivalent to executing a script with the command-line argument of <code>-F,</code> with the benefit of not being required to remember to add the argument when running the script.</p>
<h2>15 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>END{print FNR}
</code></pre>
<p>Prints the number of lines/records in the last file read. The <code>END</code> pattern is true after all input has been read, similar to <code>wc -l</code></p>

<h2>Length 1 Snippet</h2>
<pre><code>+
</code></pre>
<p><code>+</code> and <code>-</code> are most basic instructions to modify tape. On Modulo-256 version, <code>-</code> equals to 255 <code>+</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 2 Snippet</h2>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;

<p>Instead of cleaning up current memory, it's usually shorter to just go to a clean position</p>
<h2>Length 3 Snippet</h2>

<p>An infinite loop.</p>
<h2>Length 4 Snippet</h2>
<pre><code>[-&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>Decrease elements from here by one, until meeting 0.</p>
<p>It's useful to have unbalanced pointer moving in a loop, although that'd make it harder to understand.</p>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>
<pre><code>[-&gt;+&lt;]

<p>Add current value to the next value.</p>
<p>There's no <code>move</code> or <code>add</code> in brainfuck. The only way to move value is by a loop, each time reduce source by one and increase destination.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu8" class="pu"><h1>JSFuck</h1>
<h2>Length 6</h2>
<pre><code>+[![]]
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>![]</code> is <code>false</code>, <code>[![]].toString()</code> is <code>&quot;false&quot;</code>, which isn't a valid number. Therefore, when converting to number, it returns <code>NaN</code>.</p>
<p>I decide to make it here because it's the first time we can create an uppercase letter, and uppercase letter usually take a lot of code to generate.</p>
<h2>Length 5</h2>
<pre><code>+!+[]
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned before (in the length 4 section), <code>!+[]</code> produces <code>true</code>. Also, as mentioned before (in the length 1 section), <code>+</code> can cast to number.</p>
<p>Therefore, this code casts <code>true</code> to number, which is <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>This snippet can be chained indefinitely to produce any number you want.</p>
<p>For example, <code>2</code> would be <code>+!+[]+!+[]</code>, and <code>3</code> would be <code>+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned before (in the length 4 section), <code>+!![]</code> is also valid.</p>
<h2>Length 4</h2>
<pre><code>!+[]
</code></pre>
<p>The operation <code>!</code> casts to boolean.</p>
<p>The number <code>0</code>, the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, the <code>undefined</code>, and the <code>NaN</code> are all treated as <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Other objects are treated as <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike Python, the empty array <code>[]</code> and the empty <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Object_literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">object literal</a> <code>{}</code> are treated as <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is the shortest snippet to produce <code>true</code>. It is equivalent to <code>!0</code>.</p>
<p><code>!![]</code> would also work.</p>
<h2>Length 3</h2>
<pre><code>+[]
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned before, <code>+</code> casts to integer. In this case, it would be evaluated to <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>However, also as mentioned before, <code>+</code> can join two arrays to form a string.</p>
<p>Therefore, <code>+[]+[]</code> is really <code>0+[]</code> which would produce <code>&quot;0&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 2</h2>
<pre><code>++
</code></pre>
<p>There are really only <code>36</code> length-2 snippets.</p>
<p>Out of the <code>36</code> snippets, I chose this one.</p>
<p>This is the shortest way to add <code>1</code> to a number.</p>
<p>This function is very strange.</p>
<p>For example, <code>v=1; ++v</code> works, but <code>++1</code> does not.</p>
<p>For example, <code>v=[]; ++v</code> also works (empty array <code>[]</code> is implicitly cast to <code>0</code>), but <code>++[]</code> does not.</p>
<p>To make it work in JSFuck, you would have to type <code>++[[]][+[]]</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>[[]][+[]]</code> is really <code>[[]][0]</code>, which is an empty array <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>Why <code>++[[]][+[]]</code> works but not <code>++[]</code> is yeond me.</p>
<h2>Length 1</h2>
<pre><code>+
</code></pre>
<p><code>+</code> can convert a string to a number, as well as adding two arrays together to form a string. For example, <code>+&quot;0&quot;</code> would result in the number <code>0</code>, and <code>[1]+[0]</code> will result in the string <code>&quot;10&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>All JSFuck programs are valid Javascript programs. However, JSFuck aims to use only 6 operators to do everything: <code>+![]()</code>. Also, its name is derived from JS (javascript) and Brainfuck. Brainfuck only uses 8 operators.</p>

<h3>Length 18 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>(min-width: 700px)
</code></pre>
<p>This is part of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">media query</a>, which allows certain styles to only show for certain media. Perhaps the most common is min- and max-width, which is the basis of responsive web design, allowing the site to look different depending on the device width. While a news site might expand to fill a widescreen monitor by fitting several stories next to each other, on a phone there is only enough room for one.</p>
<p>The most common way of using media queries is within a stylesheet: the rules are surrounded by <code>{}</code> brackets, prefixed with <code>@media ([rule])</code>, like so: (click &quot;Full page&quot; to see the background color change from tomato to turquoise)</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="false" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">

@media (min-width: 700px) {
  body {
    background-color: turquoise;
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Media queries can also tell you even more data about a device, such as its resolution, color, and orientation.</p>
<h3>Length 15 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>input:checked
</code></pre>
<p>Another pseudo-selector, this selects all <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s that are checkboxes (or radio buttons or dropdown options) that have been selected by the user. This gives CSS an unintended way to register clicks, allowing for everything from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/functional-css-tabs-revisited/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tabs</a> to <a href="http://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/gpvVZv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a reaction time test</a>.</p>
<p>These work by having a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> for the checkbox that checks the box when clicked anywhere on the text. The checkbox is hidden, leaving just the label. Then the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">adjacent sibling selector</a> <code>+</code> is used to select the label. Here is a simple example (click &quot;Show code snippet&quot;).</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="true" data-console="false" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden">

<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;input type="radio" name="foo" id="radio1" /&gt;
  &lt;label for="radio1"&gt;Click me!&lt;/label&gt;

&lt;input type="radio" name="foo" id="radio2" checked /&gt;
  &lt;label for="radio2"&gt;Click me!&lt;/label&gt;

<h3>Length 14 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>columns:4 12em
</code></pre>
<p>CSS has the ability to break up long text into several shorter columns, as commonly found in newspapers. The <code>columns</code> property above is shorthand for <code>column-count: 4; column-width: 12em</code>, which tells the browser to break the text into at <em>most</em> 4 columns, at <em>least</em> 12em wide. There are more related properties that allow you to control other aspects, such as gap and rule between columns.</p>
<h3>Length 12 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>display:flex
</code></pre>
<p>This is the code to make flexboxes, which do just what you think: make boxes flexible. This does away with hacky methods developers used and adds a lot of functionality. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSS-Tricks</a> has an excellent guide to all things flexbox that explain them in more detail.</p>
<h3>Length 11 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>:last-child
</code></pre>
<p>This is a pseudo-class that selects each element that is the last child of its parent. For example, take the following HTML code.</p>
<pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Foo&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Baz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A selector of <code>p:last-child</code> would match the Baz paragraph because it is last. However, if there were a different element, say <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, after Baz, that selector would match nothing because there is no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> that is the last child. For this, you would use <code>p:last-of-type</code>, which ignores all non-paragraph elements and finds only the last <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, regardless of whether it is last overall.</p>
<p>A useful cousin of this selector is <code>:nth-child</code>. It is clear that <code>:nth-child(3)</code> would match the third element, but you can also use more complex queries, such as <code>:nth-child(2n+1)</code>, which matches every other element. This is useful for styling every other row of a long table for easy contrast. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mozilla Developer Network</a> lists several ways to powerfully use <code>nth-child</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 10 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>!important
</code></pre>
<p>This causes other, more specific rules to be overridden. It is placed after a declaration, before the semicolon. Note that in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">most situations</a>, you should not use this, because it can make debugging a nightmare, but I will take this opportunity to talk about <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">specificity</a></em>, which is where the &quot;cascading&quot; in CSS's name comes from.</p>
<p>This basically means that a declaration that applies to a few elements (i.e. it's more specific) will be used in favor of a declaration that applies to more elements. For example, take these HTML and CSS snippets (click &quot;Run code snippet&quot; to see what happens):</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="false" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.green { color: green; }
#red { color: red; }
* { color: blue; }
p { color: yellow; }</code></pre>
<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;p class="green" id="red"&gt;Foo bar&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>You'll notice that even though all three rules match the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, the red color gets applied because it is the most specific: as mentioned below: <code>#red</code> is an ID, which should be unique to only one element, while you can have any number of <code>green</code> classes or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements. The complete specificity order is found in the Mozilla Developer Network page linked above. In the following snippet, nothing has changed except for the addition of <code>!important</code>, but it causes the universal selector, which is the least specific, to take precedence over all the others.</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="false" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.green { color: green; }
#red { color: red; }
* { color: blue !important; }
p { color: yellow; }</code></pre>
<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;p class="green" id="red"&gt;Foo bar&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h3>Length 9 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>max-width
</code></pre>
<p>This property is pretty self-explanatory: it defines the maximum width an element can have. One common example usage is for a webpage that has large amounts of text, such as a blog post or news article.  You would want the text to take up as much horizontal space as possible on any device, so you'd set the width of each paragraph element to <code>100%</code>. However, on wide screens, lines become too long to navigate comfortably, so you might set the <code>max-width</code> to <code>1000px</code> so the width stops increasing after the window is wider than 1000 pixels. Predictably, there are also <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-height</code> properties.</p>
<h3>Length 8 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>q::after
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a pseudo-element (slightly different from the pseudo-<em>class</em> in the length 6 snippet below) after every <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element, which can be separately styled from the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> itself. This is commonly used with the <code>content</code> property, which allows you to add text that will show up after the element. <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> is used to designate inline quotations, so you would add the declaration <code>content: '&quot;'</code> to automatically add quotation marks after every quote.</p>
<p>As you might guess, there is also a <code>::before</code> pseudo-element which does the same thing, except before the element. The two of these working together can be used to make all sorts of shapes like a heart or star using only one HTML element and CSS (which is based on the <em>box</em> model). You can see many of these and their code on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>
<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>b{top:0
</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the shortest possible full &quot;programs&quot; that can actually do something. It demonstrates the format of a CSS rule: before the braces is the selector, which is usually an HTML tag, class, or ID, but it can also be more advanced, like some of the snippets below. The <code>b</code> in this example selects every HTML <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> (bold text) element.</p>
<p>The inside of the braces are the declarations. (The closing brace of the last rule is optional.) Each declaration is a pair of property and value, separated by semicolons (again, the last semicolon is optional). In this example, <code>top</code> is the property, <code>0</code> is the value, and they are separated by a colon. A more readable and realistic version of the above would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>b {
  top: 0;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 6 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>:hover
</code></pre>
<p>This is a pseudo-class selector that is applied when an element is hovered over with the mouse. You see this all the time, for example in comments on a Stack Exchange site that show upvote and flag buttons on hover, or links that change color when you mouse over them. There are other state selectors like active, focus, and visited.</p>
<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>[alt]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a selector to match any element with the <code>alt</code> attribute (most often used for specifying alternative text if an <code>img</code> cannot be displayed), regardless of what it is or if it is empty. You can use <code>[alt=foo]</code> to only match elements with an <code>alt</code> value of <code>foo</code>. There are several others for attributes containing, beginning with, and ending with a value.</p>
<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>#38b
</code></pre>
<p>CSS uses hex triplets to specify color, which consist of three two-digit hexadecimal numbers, two each for the amount of red, green, and blue present in the color. If both digits in each set are the same, as in <code>#3388bb</code>, it can be shortened to just the first digit of each, as in the snippet above. There are 2<sup>24</sup> = 16777216 possible colors. The color is shown below:</p>

<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>p#s
</code></pre>
<p>This matches a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (paragraph) element with the ID <code>s</code>. IDs are similar to classes, which are explained below, except classes can be used on any number of elements and an element can have multiple classes, whereas each ID should only be used once, and elements can only have one ID.</p>
<p>IDs can also be used as targets, where a link to an ID links directly to that element on the page. For example, a link to this question ending in <code>#49172</code> will link directly to this answer, because it has ID <code>49172</code>. You can chain IDs and classes: <code>.a#b.c</code> matches an element with ID <code>b</code> and classes <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.a
</code></pre>
<p>This matches an element with the class <code>a</code>, used for styling multiple instances of a style. For example, you might use <code>&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;</code> for styling only external links, different from all links.</p>
<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>*
</code></pre>
<p>This is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">universal selector</a>. It matches any element on the page, although it is the most expensive selector.</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is not your typical programming language, as it is used for styling HTML web pages, but I thought it still would be interesting for this challenge.</p>
<p>CSS came at a time when design on the Internet was a mess, with designers abusing HTML for styling purposes (<code>&lt;table&gt;</code> has never been the same). Adoption wasn't consistent across browsers, causing headaches for designers who had to resort to &quot;hacks&quot; to get their code to work cross-browser. These different implementations continue to this day, although much better, in the form of vendor prefixes.</p>

<p><strong>Japt</strong> is a shortened version of <strong>Ja</strong>vaScri<strong>pt</strong>, created by myself in early November 2015.</p>
<h2>Click on any snippet's header to try it in the <a href="http://ethproductions.github.io/japt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter!</a></h2>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Japt is heavily based off of JavaScript. After transpiling Japt's syntax features to JS, it is evaluated as vanilla JS. This allows easy building of an online interpreter.</p>

<pre><code>Ð
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, the letter Eth. <em>(Don't tell anyone, but it's my personal favorite.)</em> This is the first example of one of Japt's defining features: <strong>Unicode shortcuts</strong>. Each one-byte character from <code>¡</code> to <code>Þ</code> has or will be assigned two or more chars to stand in for. <code>Ð</code> happens to stand for <code>new Date(</code>.</p>
<p>Another nifty feature is that <strong>missing parentheses are automatically added</strong>. This code transpiles to:</p>
<pre><code>new Date()
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, <strong>implicit output</strong>: The last expression (separated by <code>;</code>) is automatically sent to the output box. On my computer, the output comes up like so:</p>
<pre><code>Sun Nov 29 2015 09:37:30 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)
</code></pre>
<p>One important thing to note is that in the interest of saving bytes, Japt replaces each close-paren with two close-parens, and each space with one. So instead of writing</p>
<pre><code>Ð)+1
</code></pre>
<p>you would have to write</p>
<pre><code>Ð +1
</code></pre>

<pre><code>U²
</code></pre>
<p>Now we get to <strong>implicit input</strong>: <code>N</code> is pre-defined to the evaluated input. <code>U</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>W</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code> are set to the first six items. If there are less than six items in the input, the remaining vars are set to 0 instead.</p>
<p>Also, the Unicode shortcut <code>²</code> is set to <code>p2 </code>. This means that the code is really <code>Up2</code>. All lower­case letters are reserved for <strong>methods</strong>, and are transpiled to e.g. <code>.a(</code>. This makes the code</p>
<pre><code>U.p(2)
</code></pre>
<p>Japt has three main <strong>data types</strong>: strings, arrays, and numbers. And all three of these have different meanings for <code>.p()</code>. Here's what happens with the different input types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>string.p()</code> = <code>.repeat()</code>, so the input is repeated twice and outputted.</li>
<li><code>array.p()</code> = <code>.push()</code>, so <code>2</code> is added to the end of the array, and its new length is outputted.</li>
<li><code>number.p()</code> = <code>.pow()</code> (hence the shortcut being <code>²</code>), so the input is squared and outputted.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Uæq
</code></pre>
<p>One of Japt's main strengths is its large selection of <strong>array manipulation functions</strong>. There are many helpful functions that we could use on arrays; more than the 26 lowercase letters can hold. So to get around this limit, we can use the lowercase accented letters in the range <code>à-ÿ</code>. <code>æ</code> returns the first item in the array that returns truthily when run through a function.</p>
<p>Another strength is <strong>auto-functions</strong>: if a lowercase letter is given in place of a function, it transpiles to e.g. <code>function(c){return c.q()}</code>.</p>
<p>So, this code returns the first item whose <code>.q()</code> returns with a truthy value. But what is truthy? As it turns out, almost everything: the only values in JS that are not truthy are <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>null</code>, and <code>undefined</code>. And <code>q</code> is square root on numbers, which returns <code>NaN</code> for negatives and <code>0</code> for 0. So if the input is an array of numbers, this returns the first positive one:</p>
<pre><code>-3   NaN    falsy
 0   0      falsy
-6   NaN    falsy
 7  ~2.646  truthy!
 4   2      truthy
-1   NaN    falsy
</code></pre>
<p>This example returns <code>7</code>. But what about non-numbers? <code>q</code> splits a string into chars, and joins an array, so the only falsy value that's not a number will be the empty array:</p>
<pre><code>[]       &quot;&quot;         falsy
[1,2,3]  &quot;123&quot;      truthy!
&quot;&quot;       []         truthy
&quot;abc&quot;    ['a,'b,'c] truthy
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>q</code> trick has many other applications, which we will look at later.</p>

<pre><code>¡XcV
</code></pre>
<p>Let's take a look at <strong>functions</strong> now. <code>¡</code> stands for <code>Um@</code>, and <code>@</code> stands for <code>XYZ{</code>, which is transpiled to <code>function(X,Y,Z){</code>. So here we have:</p>
<pre><code>U.m(function(X,Y,Z){return X.c(V)})
</code></pre>
<p>This results in a whole tree of possible outputs, depending on the types of <code>U</code> and <code>V</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <code>U</code> is a number, <code>m</code> is <code>Math.min</code> and returns <code>NaN</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <code>U</code> is a string, <code>m</code> maps each char <code>X</code> to:</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <code>V</code> is not specified or 0, <code>X</code>'s char code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Otherwise, <code>NaN</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <code>U</code> is an array, <code>m</code> maps each item <code>X</code> to:</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <code>X</code> is a number: <code>X</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <code>X</code> is a string: if <code>V||0</code> is within the length of <code>X</code>, the char code at <code>V</code> in <code>X</code>; otherwise, <code>NaN</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <code>X</code> is an array: <code>X</code> flattened (i.e. all items in sub-arrays are brought up to the base array).</p>

<pre><code>`HÁM!
</code></pre>
<p>Believe it or not, this doesn't give the user a ham. ;) On the contrary, it outputs a warm welcome:</p>
<pre><code>Hello!
</code></pre>
<p>How does this work, you ask? Well, the secret lies in the backtick: Japt uses the <a href="http://ed-von-schleck.github.io/shoco/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shoco library</a> for <strong>string compression</strong>. To compress text, you call <code>Oc</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>Oc&quot;Hello!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you the compressed string. To decompress, you can do one of two things: 1) Use <code>Od&quot;...&quot;</code>, or 2) wrap the text in backticks. This is why Japt is shorter in the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/63338/42545">&quot;Hello, World!&quot; challenge</a> than almost every other language that doesn't have a built-in for &quot;Hello, World!&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing: If you have a quotation mark or backtick (or dollar sign, or curly bracket, or parenthesis, or any combination of the above) at the end of a program, you can leave it off, saving an extra 1 or more bytes.</p>
<h3><a href="http://ethproductions.github.io/japt?v=master&amp;code=Va6krHJe&amp;input=WzAgMSAyIDMgNCA2IDggMTIgMTYgMjQgMzcgMTI3IDEwMjkwOF0=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 6</a></h3>
<pre><code>U®¤¬r^
</code></pre>
<p>Lots of Unicode shortcuts here: <code>®</code> stands for <code>m_</code>, and <code>_</code> stands for <code>Z{Z</code>. <code>¤</code> stands for <code>s2 </code>, and <code>¬</code> stands for <code>q </code>. Putting this all together, we get:</p>
<pre><code>UmZ{Zs2 q r^
</code></pre>
<p>If the input is an array of numbers, this maps each item <code>Z</code> to <code>Z.toString(2).split(&quot;&quot;)</code>. But what is that <code>r^</code> at the end? <code>array.r()</code> is the <code>reduce</code> function, which takes in a function of at least two parameters, and uses that function to combine each item with the previous value. As an example:</p>
<pre><code>[0,1,2,3,4]rXY{X+Y
</code></pre>
<p>This reduces the array with addition. The result is 10; it works like this:</p>
<pre><code>prev value: 0; next value: 1; result: 1
prev value: 1; next value: 2; result: 3
prev value: 3; next value: 3; result: 6
prev value: 6; next value: 4; result: 10.
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>^</code> is not a function, so what happens? Japt has a nice feature where if the first thing inside parentheses is an operator, it's transpiled to a function which takes in two arguments, and returns the result of the args being combined with that operator. So this whole program ends up as:</p>
<pre><code>U.m(function(Z){return Z.s(2).q().r(function(a,b){return a^b})})
</code></pre>
<p>Which maps through each number, turns it to its an array of its binary digits, and finally returns <code>1</code> if this contains an odd number of <code>1</code>s, and <code>0</code> otherwise.</p>

<pre><code>Uà ®r!-
</code></pre>
<p>More array manipulation: <code>à</code> returns all possible combinations of the array. You've already seen that <code>®</code> is a shortcut for <code>m_</code>, and that <code>r-</code> would reduce by subtraction. But what does <code>r!-</code> mean? The difference is simple: an operator preceded by <code>!</code> reverses the order of the resulting function's arguments. Here's exactly how this works:</p>
<pre><code>Code  Transpiled
r-    .r(function(a,b){return a-b})
r!-   .r(function(a,b){return b-a})
</code></pre>
<p>After putting this all together, we end up with:</p>
<pre><code>U.à().m(function(Z){return Z.r(function(a,b){return b-a})})
</code></pre>
<p>This takes all possible combinations of the input array, then reduces each by subtracting the previous result from the current item. For example, <code>[1 3 7]</code> becomes:</p>
<pre><code>Comb.    Reduction       Result
1 3 7    3-1=2, 7-2=5    5
1 3      3-1=2           2
1 7      7-1=6           6
1        1=1             1
3 7      7-3=4           4
3        3=3             3
7        7=7             7

<pre><code>Uf¬å+ ä^
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray for array manipulation! <code>å</code> is a cumulative reduce (i.e. like <code>r</code>, but returns an array of each intermediate value), and <code>ä</code> maps each adjacent pair of items through the function. As shown before, <code>¬</code> becomes <code>q </code>, which performs square root on numbers. So if the input is an array of numbers, <code>fq </code> filters out the non-positive ones, as shown in Snippet 3. Let's try it:</p>
<pre><code>U   [1,2,-3,5,0,7]  [1,0,-1,1,1,0,1,1]
f¬  [1,2,5,7]       [1,1,1,1,1]

ä^  [2,11,7]        [3,1,7,1]
</code></pre>
<p><code>q</code> has even more potential in this area, which will be demonstrated in a future snippet. This program is obviously not super useful, but hey, messing around with math is fun. :)</p>

<pre><code>+² Æn -X²
</code></pre>
<p>Here I wanted to showcase one of the features which has the largest impact on the order of inputs: Auto-insertion (specifically of <code>U</code> in this case).</p>
<p>In some situations, attempting to use a method or operator when there is no value immediately to the left of it will cause the transpiler to insert a variable of its own instead of giving an error. In this snippet these three rules are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of a line, <code>U</code> will be inserted</li>
<li>At the start of a function, <code>U</code> will be inserted</li>
<li>At the right side of an operator, when the left side is a single variable, the same variable will be inserted</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus this piece of code is identical to the snippet above after auto-insertions and without shortcuts:</p>
<pre><code>U+Up2  oXYZ{Un -Xp2
^ ^         ^
| |         | Auto-inserted at the beginning of a function
| |
| | Auto-inserted because the left side is just &quot;U&quot;
|
| Auto-inserted at the beginning of a line
</code></pre>
<p>What the code does is compute the sum of U and U squared, and then for each value X in the range from 0 to that sum it outputs -U minus X squared. This exact snippet isn't particularly useful, but auto-insertion definitely can save a few bytes especially if you pick the right order of inputs.</p>
<p>Lots to come as I have time to add it!</p>

<p>This 'language' is the combination of an interpreted language, GP, a C library called PARI, and a REPL called gp. It is a domain-specific language, specializing in algebraic number theory. You can do math very easily in GP, but some things (like string manipulation) are impractical.</p>
<p>Length 1: <code>'</code></p>
<p>This command can be used to quote, but not in the usual way. <code>'x</code> means &quot;the literal polynomial x, not the value in the variable x&quot;. In postfix, it means the derivative. Tricky example: <code>'x'</code> is 1 -- the derivative of the polynomial x. (But it is the 0th-degree polynomial 1, not the integer 1: <code>'x'==1</code> is true, but <code>'x'===1</code> is false since <code>type('x')</code> is <code>&quot;t_POL&quot;</code> not <code>&quot;t_INT&quot;</code>.) <code>'</code> can also be used on functions, where it means the numerical derivative: <code>sin'(x)</code> is the same as <code>cos(x)</code>, up to roundoff error at least.</p>
<p>Length 2: <code>&lt;-</code></p>
<p>This command is used in set-builder notation. If you want to take a vector <code>v</code> and select only those values which satisfy <code>f(x)</code>, you can run <code>[x | x &lt;- v, f(x)]</code>. You can also use <code>[g(x) | x &lt;- v, f(x)]</code> to apply the function <code>g</code> to all such terms.</p>
<p>Length 3: <code>Mod</code></p>
<p>Most languages have a modulus operator, but GP also has the command <code>Mod</code>, which converts a number into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integer-mod-m</a> object. You can then do exponentiation, division, and other operations naturally, and they are fast. So <code>(99^8388607)%8388607</code> is slow (2 seconds) while <code>Mod(99, 8388607)^8388607</code> is fast (less than a microsecond). You can also use this to do modular inversion using the extended Euclidean algorithm: <code>1/Mod(3,7)</code> gives <code>Mod(5,7)</code> because (3*5)%7 = 1. (See also <code>gcdext</code>.)</p>
<p>Length 4: <code>fold</code></p>
<p>This command allows a vector to be combined pairwise with a given function. Note that some functions already fold automatically where that would be useful: <code>lcm</code>, <code>gcd</code>, <code>Str</code>, and (in some sense) <code>chinese</code>.</p>
<p>Length 5: <code>3^3^3</code></p>
<p>This yields 7625597484987, demonstrating not only that <code>^</code> represents exponentiation rather than a bitwise operator but that exponentiation is right-associative. This is the mathematical convention, but many other languages are left-associative instead, giving the much smaller 19683. See <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Operator_precedence#PARI.2FGP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PARI/GP Operator Precedence</a> or section 2.4 in the <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/2.7.0/users.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">User's Guide to PARI/GP</a>.</p>
<p>Length 6: <code>fordiv</code></p>
<p>GP has many types of loops built in which go beyond the standard C-style <code>for</code>, <code>do</code>, and <code>while</code>. This one takes a number and loops once for each of its divisors, setting the dummy variable equal to the divisor itself. There is also the summation version <code>sumdiv</code> which adds up all the results of the inner loop. Thus <code>sumdiv(720720, n, n^2)</code> gives the sum of the squares of the divisors of 720720. (You could already do this with <code>sigma(720720, 2)</code> but this version is more customizable.) Note also that fast factorization techniques are used, not just trial division, so the result is computed quickly.</p>
<p>Length 7: <code>V ec(x)</code></p>
<p>This demonstrates two principles of GP. First is the ability to convert between different forms with conversion commands like <code>Pol</code> (polynomial), <code>Vec</code> (vector), <code>Vecsmall</code> (vector of small integers), <code>Set</code> (set), <code>Mat</code> (matrix), etc. Second is the fact that the parser completely ignores spaces, so <code>V ec</code> is the same as <code>Vec</code>. Space is added only for readability. This can, however, have interesting effects on constrained coding!</p>
<p>Length 8: <code>eta(I/4)</code></p>
<p>PARI/GP includes a large number of built-in special functions. eta(z) represents an infinite product (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_eta_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dedekind eta function</a>) and is computed efficiently, but you can also compute this instance 'directly' as <code>prodinf(n=1,1-exp(-Pi*n/2))</code>.</p>
<p>Length 9: <code>asinh('x)</code></p>
<p>As hinted at by the first snippet, <code>'</code> means that x is to be treated as a formal variable. (By default it, and all other variables, are purely formal, but you could also assign to it: <code>x=1</code>, for example. If you haven't assigned to it you can drop the <code>'</code>.) When the inverse hyperbolic sine function gets an argument which includes a formal variable, it computes a Maclaurin series in that variable, so this results in <code>x - 1/6*x^3 + ...</code> where the terms continue depending on your settings (<code>default(seriesprecision)</code> controls these settings). You can also force GP to use a desired number of terms with the <code>O</code> command:  <code>asinh(x+O(x^4))</code>.</p>
<p>Length 10: <code>-eint1(-9)</code></p>
<p><code>eint1</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_integral" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exponential integral</a>, which can be used (among other things!) to estimate the number of primes up to a certain number. This provides an estimate for the number of primes up to <em>e</em><sup>9</sup>, and it's pretty good: the exact answer is 1019 and this gives about 1037.</p>
<p>Length 11: <code>teichmuller</code></p>
<p><code>teichmuller(x)</code> gives the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teichm%C3%BCller_character" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Teichmüller character</a> of <em>x</em>, that is, the unique (<em>p</em>-1)-th root of unity congruent to x / p^k modulo p with k maximal. PARI/GP has strong support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_field_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">class field theory</a> and has many nontrivial functions built in.</p>
<p>Length 12: <code>hilbert(3,5)</code></p>
<p>Computes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_symbol" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hilbert symbol</a> of 3 and 5. Since the third argument is not given, the command defaults to doing the calculation 'at infinity', that is, the completion is the real numbers. You could also pass a prime <em>p</em> in which case it would instead use the <em>p</em>-adic numbers as the completion.</p>
<p>Length 13: <code>thue(x^2+3,7)</code></p>
<p>This is where GP's specialized functions begin to shine. <code>thue</code> solves a <a href="http://www.math.uoc.gr/~tzanakis/Papers/PracticalSolutionThueEq.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Thue equation</a>, which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">irreducible</a> bivariate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">homogeneous polynomial</a> of degree at least 3. This example uses <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3 <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 7, which has four integer solutions. This command has many additional options, for which see the help entries <code>??thue</code> and <code>??thueinit</code>. Note that although the polynomial of interest is bivariate and homogeneous, it is entered in GP as an inhomogeneous univariate polynomial. This can be achieved by setting either variable to 1.</p>
<p>Length 14: <code>Vec(eta('x)^2)</code></p>
<p>This computes the Taylor series of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_eta_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dedekind eta function</a>, squares it, and returns the coefficients. This is a slick way to compute sequence <a href="https://oeis.org/A002107" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A002107</a> in the OEIS, the number of partitions of a number into an even number of distinct parts minus number of partitions of the same number into an odd number of distinct parts, with 2 types of each part. (Replacing the <code>2</code> in the program with a different number changes the number of parts accordingly; using 1, for instance, yields <a href="https://oeis.org/A010815" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A010815</a> instead.)</p>
<p>Note that the <code>'</code> is optional (but good form), see the length 1 snippet.</p>
<p>Length 15: <code>hyperu(-38,9,1)</code></p>
<p>This computes 76! * (binomial(38,0)/38! - binomial(38,1)/39! + binomial(38,2)/40! - ... + binomial(38,38)/76!) using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluent_hypergeometric_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>U</em>-confluent hypergeometric function</a>.

<h2>1 byte</h2>
<pre><code>a
</code></pre>
<p><code>a</code> is not (normally) a defined command in <code>zsh</code>, so why is it useful? Because it generates an error message (<code>zsh: command not found: a</code>). Errors are a key part of <code>zsh</code> golfing, because it (and other languages in the Bourne shell family) is unique among practical programming languages in their error handling - almost all errors are ignored by default, which is great for golfing. Also, since errors are so easily to generate, they are also essentially the best way to implement conditionals:</p>
<h2>2 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>&amp;&amp;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator chains two commands together, but only runs the second if the first succeeds. There is also <code>||</code>, which does the opposite. They are pretty much the shortest way to implement conditional expressions, because if you can make your command generate an error in some circumstances, then you can use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> instead of a bulky <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<h2>3 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>&gt;$1
</code></pre>
<p>This is probably one of the most used trigraphs in my <code>zsh</code> answers, but what does it do?</p>
<p>Well, the parts in isolation are <code>$1</code> is the first command-line argument, and <code>&gt;</code> redirects a command to a file. But there is no command? Ah, but when no command is provided, <code>zsh</code> uses the value of the <code>NULLCMD</code> environment variable, or <code>cat</code> by default. Therefore, it <code>cat</code>s all of <code>stdin</code> to a file named the first command-line argument. <code>stdin</code> is generally not the optimal input method, and therefore I don't use it often, so it doesn't generally matter what goes into the file, but it matters that the file is created.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>Why does it matter that we create a file? Because the shortest way to do string pattern-matching in <code>zsh</code> is with so-called &quot;globbing&quot;. A glob pattern-matches to a file. I've given an overview of globbing syntax <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/219491">here</a>, but it's generally the easiest and shortest way to check if two strings are equal, or check for substrings or match all sorts of patterns (especially with the <code>--extendedglob</code> option). You can even create patterns dynamically, like I used in my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/217969"><em>Is it a lobster number?</em> answer</a>.</p>
<p><sub>[1] If <code>stdin</code> is really needed, you can use <code>:&gt;$1</code> which pipes a no-op command, or enable the <code>--shnullcmd</code> option which changes that <code>cat</code> default to a no-op</sub></p>
<h2>4 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>echo
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>echo</code> builtin prints a string, like <code>echo hello</code>. Pretty simple, right? But we can actually do 2 bytes better, with the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;hello
</code></pre>
<p>This is called &quot;here-string&quot; redirection, and it's equivalent to doing <code>echo hello | command</code>. Like before, there is no command, however, so it's passed to <code>cat</code> (see <code>NULLCMD</code> above) and hence to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> syntax has some limitations, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>it only expects a single word, so some expansion/word splitting techniques don't work</li>
<li>the expression on the right is evaluated in a subshell, so assigning variables there won't take effect outside the command</li>
<li>it's not a true command, so it can't be aliased and can't always be used in some complex statements</li>
<li>if you want to print only a newline, a bare <code>echo</code> is one byte shorter than <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>...but it can be chained without command separators, like <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;a&lt;&lt;&lt;b</code>, because multiple redirections are going to <code>cat</code> (thanks to multIOs). This is particurlarly useful in <code>eval</code> &quot;loops&quot; (see <strong>7 bytes</strong>)</p>
<h2>5 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>set -y
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike most shells, zsh does not perform field splitting by default, so variable expansions almost never need to be quoted. The <code>-y</code> option re-enables such splitting, which is useful in some circumstances.</p>
<p><code>zsh</code> in fact has <a href="https://tio.run/##qyrO@P@/qjhDQVc3IzWn4P9/AA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a plethora of command-line options</a>, most of which can also be set dynamically with <code>set</code>, <code>setopt</code>, or <code>unsetopt</code>; some more interesting options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-e</code>: errors are no longer ignored, and the shell exits immediately if one happens. If you can generate errors in some circumstances, this can act like a logical AND over the program which is useful for <a href="/questions/tagged/decision-problem" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;decision-problem&#39;" rel="tag">decision-problem</a>s</li>
<li><code>-n</code>: <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/218012">disables all command execution</a>. Who knows why...</li>
<li><code>--extendedglob</code>: enables a whole load of extra syntax goodies for globbing</li>
<li><code>-F</code>: globbing is disabled. This is useful if you don't need to do any pattern matching but want to include unquoted special characters like <code>*</code>. Particularly useful in <a href="/questions/tagged/ascii-art" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ascii-art&#39;" rel="tag">ascii-art</a></li>
<li><code>--forcefloat</code>: changes division in arithemtic expansions to always produce a <code>float</code>, even if both operands are integers</li>
<li><code>--cprecedences</code>: changes operator precedence of bitwise operators in arithmetic expansions. By default they are tighter-binding than even exponentiation, and this makes them exactly as they are in C[2]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the full documentation for all of these in <code>man zshoptions</code>.</p>
<p><sub>[2] although this still isn't the most sensible, as comparison operators are tighter than bitwise AND/XOR/OR<sub>, in what may go down in history as Dennis Ritchie's greatest mistake</sub></sub></p>
<h2>6 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>hash -d
</code></pre>
<p>While not so useful in <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a>, but this provides a mechanism very handy for interactive command-prompt use of <code>zsh</code>. You may know that <code>~</code> refers to the home directory; well now you can define more directory aliases of the form <code>~a</code>. For example, <code>hash -d a=/usr/local</code> means that <code>echo ~a/bin/cat</code> will print <code>/usr/local/bin/cat</code>.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/219712">might be useful</a> in <a href="/questions/tagged/restricted-source" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;restricted-source&#39;" rel="tag">restricted-source</a>, but I haven't actually found a use for it yet outside my dotfiles.</p>
<h2>7 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>{1..$1}
</code></pre>
<p><code>{1..$1}</code> constructs a range from <code>1</code> to the input, and expands them as separate words. This alone is not too interesting, but if you put some more string around it, like <code>x{1..$1}y</code>, then it can create a range with the string, like <code>x1y x2y x3y ...</code>. If you replace <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with partial snippets of <code>zsh</code> code, and then pass them to the <code>eval</code> builtin (which evaluates strings as <code>zsh</code> code), you can construct ugly-looking loops, which are often shorter than using <code>for</code>.</p>
<h2>8 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>${a/w/} 
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>${...}</code> construct introduces parameter expansion. In the above example we are doing a text replacement on variable <code>$a</code>, and removing any <code>w</code> characters from its contents. Zsh has a pretty reasonable regex engine. Parameter expansion also does tricky things with arrays and expansion flags. <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/233823">Example</a></p>
<h2>9 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>alias A=B
</code></pre>
<p><code>alias</code> defines token aliases (in the sense of C pre-processor macros), so in the example above, <code>A</code> will be replaced with <code>B</code> in parsing. If you're using a particular construct often, this can shorten it. For example, to output a lot of stuff, you can do[4]:</p>
<pre><code>alias A=repeat\ 1000000
alias B='A A A A'
alias C='B B B B'
C C C C echo hi
</code></pre>
<p>With a little syntactic trickery, you can even alias operators:</p>
<pre><code>alias X='&amp;&amp;'
(true)X echo hi
# =&gt; hi
(false)X echo hi
# no output
</code></pre>
<p><sub>[3] Actually, for normal commands alone, it's shorter to define a function: <code>A()command $@;</code></sub>
<sub>[4] This is by far non-optimal for the most finite output, but what ever</sub></p>
<h2>10 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>emulate sh
</code></pre>
<p>zsh has a built-in command to make its behaviour much more closely mirror the POSIX shell standard (and it can also emulate <code>csh</code> and <code>ksh</code>). I don't think it will ever have a use in <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a>, except maybe <a href="/questions/tagged/cops-and-robbers" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;cops-and-robbers&#39;" rel="tag">cops-and-robbers</a> or <a href="/questions/tagged/polyglot" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;polyglot&#39;" rel="tag">polyglot</a>, but it's another reason that <code>zsh</code> should be the only shell installed on your system.</p>

<h2>Length 1 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>.
</code></pre>
<p>Halts instantly. In ErrLess, when the instruction pointer reaches the end of the program, it loops back to the start. This means that you have to explicitly halt your programs.</p>
<h2>Length 2 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>i?
</code></pre>
<p>A simple cat program that infinitely echoes stdin to stdout. <code>i</code> fetches one character of input, which is then outputted using <code>?</code>, and then the instruction pointer loops back to the start.</p>
<h2>Length 3 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>'A?
</code></pre>
<p>Prints the character <code>A</code> indefinitely. Why do you only need an opening quote, and not a closing quote? Simply because I thought that there is no need for a closing quote, since a character can only be, well, one character long.</p>
<h2>Length 4 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>12#.
</code></pre>
<p>This program does not output <code>12</code>, as one might expect, but only outputs <code>2</code>. Remember: every command is a single character long. First one is pushed to the stack, then two, then the top value of the stack is printed as a number, then the program halts.</p>
<h2>Length 5 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>e3*#.
</code></pre>
<p>The answer to life, the universe, and everything. This program outputs 42: <code>a</code> through <code>f</code> push 10 to 15 to the stack, and the <code>*</code> operator multiplies the top two elements of the stack.</p>

<div id="pu18" class="pu"><h1>C#</h1>
<p>C# is a fun, crazy mix of features from Java, C, Haskell, SQL, and a ton of other languages, and it provides a lot of really nice features and APIs.  It's also known around here for being pretty verbose, but we'll see what we can do!</p>
<p>I'll ignore the usual required boilerplate (no longer required in C#9.0):</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>class Program { public static void Main(string[] args) { ... } }
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 1:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>;
</code></pre>
<p>Commands are terminated with semicolons in C#! An empty line is perfectly valid syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>x=5f;
</code></pre>
<p>When you specify literal numbers in C#, the compiler will assume that they are ints or doubles (based on whether they have a decimal point). If you want to use a literal float, you should specify that by appending 'f' to the number, or it will be cast at runtime, incurring a slight cost.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7 (bytes):</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>s=@&quot;
&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>If you prefix a string literal with an @ sign, it becomes a &quot;verbatim&quot; string literal. Normal string literals parse escape sequences like '\n' into special characters, but verbatim literals don't, allowing you to use the backslash character without escaping it. They can also include line returns, as shown. That could save you a few bytes in golf, or make your multi-line string literals more readable. Just watch out for indentation being included in the string.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>()=&gt;x=y;
</code></pre>
<p>This expression is an anonymous function. It returns an object of type <code>Action</code> that can be passed around and also called like a function. Anonymous functions inherit the scope in which they were declared, and they pull any local variables in that scope with them anywhere they go.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>(a)=&gt;a.p;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another anonymous function that uses a parameter and return value. The expression returns an object of type <code>Func</code> (the Func itself returns the type of <code>a.p</code>. You'll use <code>Func</code> a lot to interface with Linq.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>enm.Any();
</code></pre>
<p>This is our first introduction to Linq! Linq is a set of extension methods that can be called on any object that is enumerable (implementing the IEnumerable interface) - like <code>Array</code> and <code>List</code>. IEnumerable employs lazy evaluation: it goes through the collection one item at a time, without knowing about the collection as a whole - it could even be infinite!</p>
<p>That's where <code>Any</code> comes in - it returns <code>true</code> if the Enumerable contains at least 1 item. Much better than calculating out the whole length.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>var a=1.5f;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>var</code> keyword instructs the compiler to automatically determine the type of <code>a</code>. <code>a</code> in this case will be typed as <code>Single</code>. Very handy for code golf, as it's shorter by far than almost any type name, though many dislike using it in production code.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>yield return 0;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a crazy statement you may be less familiar with. You know that objects can be enumerable by inheriting IEnumerable, but did you know that <em>functions</em> can be enumerable? Declare a function with a return type of <code>IEnumerable</code>, and have it <code>yield return</code> as many times as you want. When you get an Enumerator to the function, each call to <code>GetNext</code> will have the program execute all the code up to the next <code>yield return</code>, return that value, and then pause until you advance it again. You use <code>yield break</code> to end the iteration.</p>
<p><strong>Length 16:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>[Obsolete]int a;
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet shows an attribute. An attribute is a kind of tag you can stick on any declaration in your code. Some instruct the compiler to do certain things, like this one that emits an Obsolete warning if you call <code>a</code>. You can create your own by extending <code>Attribute</code>, and you can query them using Reflection (more on that later, perhaps). You can go meta and restrict what kind of declarations an attribute can be used on with the <code>AttributeUsage</code> attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>c.Count(t=&gt;t==3);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a handy golf method. Given a <code>Func</code> that maps an element of the enumerable <code>c</code> to <code>bool</code>, it returns the number of elements in <code>c</code> for which that <code>Func</code> returns <code>true</code>. Much nicer than writing out a loop.</p>
<p><strong>Length 18:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>foreach(T t in c);
</code></pre>
<p>This is a for-each loop. With all this talk of enumerable things, this is a much-needed structure. <code>foreach</code> is syntactic sugar that will set up an Enumerator for <code>c</code> (which must be enumerable) and iterate through it one element <code>t</code> at a time. You can alter or examine each individual element, but altering the collection itself will invalidate the enumerator.</p>
<p><strong>Length 19</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>c.Select(t=&gt;t.a/2);
</code></pre>
<p>This is your 'map' function, for functional programming fans. Select is a nice concise way to perform some arbitrary conversion (defined by a <code>Func</code> passed in) on each element of an enumerable. It returns an IEnumerable that will spit out the &quot;converted&quot; elements when you iterate it.</p>
<p><strong>Length 21</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Console.Write(&quot;Hi!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This line writes some text to stdout, and is probably one of the main reasons C# isn't used for golfing much!</p>
<p><strong>Length 23</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>typeof(T).GetMethods();
</code></pre>
<p>C# supports a very powerful feature called Reflection. Reflection lets you examine the structure of your code at runtime. For example, this call will return an Array of all methods on the specified type. You can examine those methods, call them, or even modify the values of fields and properties. Attributes (see Length 16) are a good way to tag parts of your code for use with Reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Length 25</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>from t in c select t.a/2;
</code></pre>
<p>Is that SQL? In C# code? Pretty close. This expression does the same thing as the one at Length 19.</p>
<p><strong>Length 27</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>for(var l;;l=new object());
</code></pre>
<p>C# is a garbage-collected language, which means that any memory you allocate (using the <code>new</code> keyword) can be automatically released as long as no references to it exist. This code will run happily forever even though I never explicitly free the memory created. Garbage collection has costs, though - search the web to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Length 29</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>var e=Enumerable.Range(0,99);
</code></pre>
<p><code>Enumerable.Range</code> is a potentially handy golf function. It returns a structure that can be enumerated and will yield each number in the range specified, in order. The second parameter is a count, not an index.</p>
<p><strong>Length 31</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public int pr{get;private set;}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can show a simple 'property', an OOP feature and another hallmark of C#. If you've ever used Java, you've probably made 'get' and 'set' methods for a field in order to separate their accessibility or run code when it's changed. Well, C# lets you declare that code right on top of the field, and also set separate access modifiers for getting and setting. This particular snippet automatically creates a default getter and setter, but makes the setter private.</p>
<p><strong>Length 32</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public static void m(this T o){}
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet shows a C# feature that's nice for API design. By applying the <code>this</code> modifier to the first parameter of a static method, that method becomes an &quot;extension&quot; method. Once this is declared, <code>T.m</code> can now be called on any object of type T as though it were actually a method of T. This can be used to add new functionality to any existing class, without modifying or even having access to its source code.</p>
<p><strong>Length 38</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>int f(int a,ref int b,out int c){c=0;}
</code></pre>
<p>This method showcases different types of parameter passing you can have in C#. Unmodified parameters are <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/%7Emyers/c++/notes/references.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">passed by value</a>. Parameters prefixed by <code>ref</code> are passed by reference: you can assign a completely new object to them and they will carry it back out of the method. Parameters prefixed by <code>out</code> are like additional return values: you are required to assign them a value in the method, and they are carried back out just like ref parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Length 42</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Console.Write(&quot;It is \{DateTime.Now()}.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The new C# 6 standard can save you some characters when you have to output assembled strings, using string interpolation. This feature allows you to write any expression in curly braces inside a string literal, and the string will be automatically assembled with the values of those expressions at runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Length 48</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>IEnumerable f(){for(int a=0;;)yield return a++;}
</code></pre>
<p>Just enough characters now to do something with an actual purpose! This method uses some of ideas we explored above to create an infinite Enumerable that will simply return the integers, one-by-one, starting with 0. Remember that C# employs lazy evaluation with Enumerables, so an infinite sequence is perfectly valid - you can iterate as much of the sequence as you want, and break out at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Length 56</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>int p{get{return mP;}set{mP=Math.Max(value,0);}};int mP;
</code></pre>
<p>Here is another example of a 'property' (see snippet 31). Here, I have actually defined different code snippets for <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> rather than using the automatic ones as before. This example demonstrates how you can use a property to validate the value assigned to a variable - here, the value is not allowed to become less than 0. Other good uses of properties include notifying an event when a value is changed, or rebuilding cached values that might be based on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Length 65</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>int v;public static implicit operator int(Program o){return o.v;}
</code></pre>
<p>This feature is called an implicit cast. It's sort of like an extension method in that it is static code that operates on a specific class (see snippet 32). However, the implicit cast isn't used by calling it - it's used simply by treating a <code>Program</code> object as an integer (e.g. <code>int i=new Program()</code>). When you do this, the object will be silently converted into the type you're using it as, based on the code in the implicit cast. Best practice says to only do this when no information is lost as a result of the conversion.</p>

<div id="pu19" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Pxem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pxem</a></h1>
<p>Pxem is an esoteric language designed by &quot;ぬこ&quot; (now &quot;nk.&quot;), published in 2008. Unlike many other languages, filename matters first and content is second; that is, a Pxem program consists of two strings.</p>
<h2>0 bytes</h2>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p>If content is empty, calling <code>.e</code> is equivalent to duplicating entire stack.</p>
<h2>1 byte</h2>
<pre><code>.
</code></pre>
<p>Every command has this prefix; this may be awkward when you want to push the character directly, on some problems.</p>
<h2>3 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>\001.r
</code></pre>
<p>My favorite idiom to push zero on filename. As filename cannot contain NULL character (usually), this would be needed.</p>
<h2>4 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>XX.z
</code></pre>
<p>My favorite idiom to begin pseudo comment.</p>
<h2>6 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>.c.c.z

<p>My idiom to check if stack is empty or not; goes inside if stack is empty; does not otherwise.</p>

<div id="pu20" class="pu"><h1>Lua</h1>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>
<p>Lua is a dynamic, lightweight yet powerful, highly portable (pure Ansi C), fast and easy to learn scripting language.<br>
Initially designed to be a configuration language and to be embedded in applications to script them, it is also used as a glue between native libraries and to be a standalone language on its own.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>
<pre><code>;
</code></pre>
<p>You will nearly never see a semi-colon at the end of a Lua statement (unless that's the taste of the coder!), as they are totally optional and, most of the time, unnecessary. They can be used if you want to put two statements on the same line (even then it is optional: <code>a = 5 b = 3</code> is OK (but ugly!)) and to avoid some ambiguity: <code>a = f (f1 or f2)(x)</code> can be seen as <code>a = f; (f1 or f2)(x)</code> or as <code>a = f(f1 or f2)(x)</code> (call of <code>f</code> with a function argument returns a function which is called with <code>x</code> as argument).<br>
The semi-colon can be used as separator in table literals, too.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>
<pre><code>..
</code></pre>
<p>That's the string concatenation operator in Lua. If we concatenate a number, it is converted to string. For something else than strings or numbers, the <code>__concat</code> metamethod is called (more on this later).</p>
<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>
<pre><code>nil
</code></pre>
<p>is a special value, whose main property is to be different from any other value... It is generally used to represent the absence of a useful value, equivalent to <code>null</code> in some other languages.<br>
It is the only other value that is &quot;falsy&quot; (the first one being <code>false</code>, of course), any other value is coerced to <code>true</code> in a conditional expression.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>
<pre><code>f's'
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>f</code> is called with the literal string <code>&quot;s&quot;</code>. Note that literal strings can use single quotes or double quotes as delimiters.<br>
Here, as a function called with a single, string argument, we can omit the parentheses. That's syntax sugar for <code>f('s')</code>. This can be used for writing some nice DSL.<br>
This syntax shortcut can be used too when the single argument of the function is a table.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>
<pre><code>a={1}
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>a</code> is assigned with a table with one entry, <code>1</code>.<br>
Here, the table is treated as an array. We will see they can be also associative arrays (key / value).<br>
Table is a fundamental data structure in Lua, so it is optimized and efficient: it can have both an array part (with fast numerical index access) and a hash part for the associative side.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[\n]]
</code></pre>
<p>A literal string (long format) made of two characters: backslash and n. The <code>[[ ]]</code> notation allows to write multi-line strings with no escapes inside. Newlines are kept literally (except the one immediately after the opening bracket, if any: it is ignored for convenience of formatting).<br>
Lua allows nesting of long literal strings (eg. if you want to put one inside another) by putting a number of <code>=</code> sign between the two brackets. Of course, matching closing brackets must have the same number of equal signs.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>
<pre><code>t={k=v}
</code></pre>
<p>A table defined as associative array: here, <code>k</code> is a shortcut for <code>['k']</code>, a string key (the latter annotation is useful for string keys that are not valid identifiers). <code>v</code> is a variable, its value will be the value of the entry.<br>
The key (index) can be any Lua value, except <code>nil</code>. The value can be any Lua value, but <code>nil</code> actually removes the entry.<br>
Access to entries can be done as <code>t.k</code> or as <code>t['k']</code>. The first form is valid only if the key is a valid identifier, otherwise we have to use the second form.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>
<pre><code>a,b=f(x)
</code></pre>
<p>A function can return several values (put them after the <code>return</code> keyword, separated by commas), and these values can be assigned at once to several variables.<br>
If the function provides more values than the number of left-hand variables, the extra values are dropped.<br>
If it doesn't provide enough values, the extra variables get <code>nil</code> as value.<br>
A common pattern in Lua is to return either a single value, or <code>nil</code> and an error message if something went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>
<pre><code>--[[ C ]]
</code></pre>
<p>A block comment. Line comments are marked with a double dash. Block comments extends this notation with a block of text (potentially multiline) marked between double brackets. Actually, they use a syntax similar to long literal strings, including the equal signs between the brackets, whose number allows to distinguish nested blocks. This allows to avoid conflicts with other block comments or long literal strings when commenting out a long block of code.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>
<pre><code>local v={}
</code></pre>
<p>Lua started its career as a configuration language, and is still useful as such. Because of this, its variables are global by default, ie. they are attached to the built-in <code>_ENV</code> variable and visible everywhere. That's also where we find the standard libraries, for example.<br>
Of course, this global environment is to be avoided for most usages, because of collision risks, encapsulation issues, and because a global variable is slower than a local one.<br>
Lua supports lexical scoping, we can define variables that are visible only within their scope, their chunk (from the declaration point to the end of the chunk) and the nested chunks.<br>
The statement above declares a local variable initialized to an empty table.<br>
For performance reason, a common practice is to bring global functions to the local scope, like <code>local print, find = print, string.find</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>
<pre><code>a,b,c=b,c,a
</code></pre>
<p>As seen, a function can return several values, which can be assigned in one go to several variables.<br>
It also works with several values (separated by commas) on the right hand side.<br>
The expression above cyclically permutes the values of a, b and c, ie. a takes the value of b which takes the value of c which is assigned the value of a. It is a variant of the <code>a, b = b, a</code> expression which swaps two values.</p>
<p><strong>Length 12</strong></p>
<pre><code>::L:: goto L
</code></pre>
<p>The programming world frown upon the usage of GoTo, but the Lua authors consider it is malevolent only in bad hands... They introduced it in Lua 5.2 to answer a frequently asked feature: adding a <code>continue</code> statement. The <code>goto</code> statement effectively allows to jump to the end of a loop, and also allows to break out of several nested loops. Note that Java, which has <code>goto</code> in its reserved words, doesn't implement it, but have named <code>break</code> allowing such feature...<br>
Here, <code>goto SomeName</code> jumps to a scoped label named... SomeName, which is defined by surrounding the name with double colons like <code>::SomeName::</code></p>
<p><strong>Length 13</strong></p>
<pre><code>(a or b){x=1}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function call with a table as argument. Lua allows the syntax sugar of omitting the parentheses around the argument if it is unique and it is a table, similar to the call with a string seen at length 4. It allows to create some nice DSLs...<br>
Here, we also see a logical expression between two functions: if <code>a</code> is defined, it is called with the argument. If it is not defined, ie. has the value <code>nil</code>, then that's <code>b</code> which is called (assuming it cannot be <code>nil</code>). This fallback syntax is idiomatic in Lua to provide default values to variables. It has the same function than the ternary operator of C-like languages (<code>a ? a : b</code>)<br>
Note that in Lua, logical operators are spelled out: <code>or and not</code> instead of C's <code>|| &amp;&amp; !</code>, slightly less readable for newbies.</p>
<p><strong>Length 14</strong></p>
<pre><code>_ENV={p=print}
</code></pre>
<p>Starting from Lua 5.2, local environment of a current function is exposed using variable <code>_ENV</code>. While its default value is <code>_G</code>, global environment, as any other variable, it can be assigned any value!<br />
Here, we change local environment, one from which free names are resolved, to table including single key-value pair with string key <code>p</code> and value being built-in function <code>print</code>. After this assignment, <code>p</code> will be the only resolvable name in current environment.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15</strong></p>
<pre><code>ffi.load'mylib'
</code></pre>
<p>While Lua have official implementation in ANSI C, others exist as well. One of most well-known ones is <a href="https://luajit.org/download.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LuaJIT</a>, in which this line would load C library called <code>mylib.so</code> on UNIX or <code>mylib.dll</code> on Windows and expose its functions directly to your Lua code. In addition to this, LuaJIT implements JIT-compilation for Lua code, greatly increasing its speed compared to official interpreter.<br />
However, LuaJIT's  last release was back in 2017 and it also implements Lua 5.1 API, making its usage now somewhat questionable. Newer JIT compiler for Lua is <a href="https://ravilang.github.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ravi</a>, that's based on LLVM and targets Lua 5.3 API. It also implements some language extensions.</p>
<p><strong>Length 16</strong></p>
<pre><code>function N(a)end
</code></pre>
<p>You can create global functions with the <code>function</code> keyword followed by a name.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>
<pre><code>N=function(a) end
</code></pre>
<p>The above snippet is syntactic sugar for this. <code>local function N()end</code> is sugar for <code>local N=function()end</code>. This is allowed because functions are first-class values.</p>
<p><strong>Length 18</strong></p>
<pre><code>(&quot;n=%d&quot;):format(3)
</code></pre>
<p>Wow, lots to introduce. This <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-string.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>format</code></a>s the string <code>n=%d</code>, replacing the <code>%d</code> with the number 3. The <code>:</code> denotes a method call, which is the same as calling <code>(&quot;n=%d&quot;).format(&quot;n=%d&quot;, 3)</code>. But wait, <code>&quot;n=%d&quot;</code> doesn't have the property <code>format</code>! Instead, since it isn't a table and doesn't have this property, Lua looks at its <em>metatable</em>, the global <code>string</code> table, and finds the <code>format</code> property there. Metatables are kind of like prototypes in Javascript. It then calls the <code>string.format</code> function with <code>&quot;n=%d&quot;</code> and <code>3</code> as its arguments, and returns <code>&quot;n=3&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>We reached 100, hurray! Because of this impressive milestone, I have updated this showcase with a new program.</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import re

<p>Taken from <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44532/34718">this old answer of mine</a>, which was conveniently 100 bytes.</p>
<p>This program uses regular expressions on the input string to count the number of whitespace characters, then non-whitespace characters. It will then display the counts, and the sum total. This challenge had a source restriction, requiring the programs to have an equal number of whitespace and non-whitespace characters. Running this program with itself as input will print <code>50 + 50 = 100</code>.</p>
<p><code>re.sub</code> is the function to replace using a regex. <code>re.subn</code> does the same thing, but also returns the number of replacements (in addition to the string after replacement). This program also uses a format string with a tuple of parameters to print in the proper format.</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>#-*-coding:rot13-*-
cevag h&quot;Una fubg svefg&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In Python you are able to encode the source with a specific codec. This shows how the source can be written in Rot13. The general syntax is this: <code># -*- coding: &lt;codec-name-goes-here&gt; -*-</code>.</p>
<p>Here it is translated:</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>#-*-coding:rot13-*-
print u&quot;Han shot first&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>u</code> specifies that the following string literal is a Unicode string. This is necessary if you want your strings to also be in Rot13, otherwise every string in the source is easily readable despite the encryption. Alternatively, you could use <code>.encode(&quot;Rot13&quot;)</code> after every string (don't forget to use Rot13 on this, too.) According to <a href="https://breakingcode.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/quickpost-hiding-your-python-source-with-rot13/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a>, some alternate encodings are “base64″, “uuencode”, “zlib”, or “bz2″.</p>
<p><strong>Length 33:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import cmath
print cmath.sqrt(-1)
</code></pre>
<p>This is Python's module for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" rel="nofollow noreferrer">complex (imaginary) numbers</a>. This prints <code>1j</code>, since Python conforms to engineering standards and uses <code>j</code> as the imaginary unit, though I prefer <code>i</code>, which is more commonly used in mathematics, and using <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> in addition to <code>i</code> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion" rel="nofollow noreferrer">quaternions</a>, but I digress. Read the bug/change order <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue10562" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (it won't be changed).</p>
<p><strong>Length 30:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>f=lambda n:n*f(n-1)if n else 1
</code></pre>
<p>Now we define our own factorial function using recursion and the ternary if-else! As far as I know, this is as golfed as it gets in Python. It could also be written this way: <code>f=lambda n:n and f(n-1)*n or 1</code>, showcasing a couple Python's Boolean operators (and also done in 30 characters.) See the length 15 snippet for information on the <code>lambda</code> syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Length 29:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import math
math.factorial(7)
</code></pre>
<p>Finds the factorial of 7, returning <code>5040</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 25:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import math
print math.pi
</code></pre>
<p>Python's math module provides many useful functions and constants. Here's PI. Returns <code>3.14159265359</code>. (In the code above, I counted the newline as a character.)</p>
<p><strong>Length 24:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>f=lambda y:lambda x:x**y
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of a closure. Calling <code>cube = f(3)</code> will make a cubic function that can then be called with <code>print cube(24)</code>, printing <code>13824</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 19:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>print&quot;Hello World!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, enough room to print some basic output! The space is not required here, because quotes and parentheses are also delimiters. This will only work in Python 2, since Python 3 changed the <code>print</code> function to be called like any other function. In Python 3, use <code>print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)</code>. For more information on the print function and difference between Python 2 and 3, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">What's New In Python 3.0</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 16:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>[x*3 for x in l]
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, assume <code>l</code> is a list or any other iterable object such as a string or generator. This statement is known as a <em>list comprehension</em>. It is much shorter than using the standard for loop structure. Here, it returns a list with all the numbers multiplied by 3. ALSO, <strong>strings can be multiplied!</strong> So any string in the list will be added (concatenated to itself) that number of times.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import this #:)
</code></pre>
<p>This is actually a length 11 snippet, but I realized I had forgotten to showcase Python's (awesome) <a href="http://www.wefearchange.org/2010/06/import-this-and-zen-of-python.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">easter egg</a>! Importing this module prints <em>The Zen of Python</em> (See Factoid.) Interesting fact: the module <code>this.py</code> was encoded in rot13, which I will hopefully feature later.</p>
<p><strong>Length 14:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>lambda x:x**.5
</code></pre>
<p>This defines a square root function using Python's <code>lambda</code> syntax for a function literal. Function literals in Python can only contain expressions, not statements. This lambda could be assigned to a variable, passed to a function, or executed in-line with <code>(lambda x:x**.5)(9)</code>, which returns <code>3.0</code>. Using exponents for a square root is an alternative to importing the <code>sqrt</code> function in the <code>math</code> module.</p>
<p><strong>Length 13:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>1 if x else 0
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of Python's ternary if operator. This was added in Python 2.5 to discourage coders from manually implementing it with Boolean operations. Here, <code>1</code> is return if <code>x</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, otherwise <code>0</code> is returned.</p>
<p><strong>Length 12:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>s=input(&quot;&gt;&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>This will print <code>&gt;</code> for the prompt text and allow the user to input a value. Python 2 interprets whatever value is entered, so any string needs quotes. Python 3 changed this, so that input entered is not automatically interpreted. To enter input without interpreting it in Python 2, use <code>raw_input()</code>. In Python 2, <code>input()</code> is equivalent to <code>eval(raw_input())</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>eval(&quot;2e3&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><code>2e3</code> is scientific notation for the float 2 x 10³. The <code>eval</code> function interprets and evaluates any string as an expression. In this case, it has the same result as using the literal <code>2e3</code> or <code>float(&quot;2e3&quot;)</code>. It returns <code>2000.0</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>range(013)
</code></pre>
<p>This function returns a list of integers from <code>0</code> to the octal value <code>013</code>, which is <code>11</code> (exclusive), meaning that the list will be <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code>. The function takes up to three parameters similar to the <code>slice</code> function we reviewed earlier: <code>range(start, stop[, step])</code>. The difference is, with only one parameter the parameter represents the stopping value.</p>
<p>Note that Python 3.x has no equivalent. It's <code>range</code> is similar, but is actually the same as Python 2's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#xrange" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>xrange</code></a>, returning a generator object instead of a list.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>a,b = b,a
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple assignment. This is a simple but elegant feature, allowing you to assign multiple values at the same time. In the snippet provided, it swaps <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. What about the order of evaluation, you ask? All the expressions to the right of the assignment operator are evaluated before any of the assignments are made. This beats many languages that require an intermediate assignment to a temporary variable.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>#comment
</code></pre>
<p>You know what it is... Wait, you don't? You know, those things that let you type arbitrary text to describe a line of code, making it easier to understand? No? Oh, okay...</p>
<p><strong>Length 7:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>l[::-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Again assuming <code>l</code> is a list, this will return the list in reverse order. The third argument indicates step size. Since all three arguments can be negative values, a negative step size means iterating in reverse order. The empty first and second arguments show that we're iterating over the entire list.</p>
<p>We're getting to where we can start using some more interesting constructs!</p>
<p><strong>Length 6:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>l[-6:]
</code></pre>
<p>This is called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#slice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">slice</a> operation. If <code>l</code> is a list, this will return a new list containing the last six elements of <code>l</code> as a list. <code>-6</code> represents the starting index (6 from the end), and the colon means to continue until the ending index after it (which we left blank, so to the end.) If our list contained the numbers 1 through 10, this would return <code>[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>1&lt;x&lt;5
</code></pre>
<p>One of Python's awesome features is allowing you to chain comparison operators. In many other languages, this would be typed as <code>1 &lt; x &amp;&amp; x &lt; 5</code>. It gets even better when you consider multiple comparisons:  <code>1 &lt; x &lt; y &lt; 5</code> is perfectly valid!</p>
<p><strong>Length 4:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>0256
</code></pre>
<p>An integer with a leading zero is a literal octal value. This is a nice trick for code obfuscation as well. This returns the decimal value <code>174</code>. In Python 3.x, the octal value would be written as <code>0o256</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>`3`
</code></pre>
<p>Surrounding an expression in backticks is the same as using <code>repr()</code>, which returns the string representation of an object. The function attempts to return the string in such a way that when it is passed as an argument to the <code>eval</code> function, it will return the original object. It is <em>not</em> the same as using <code>str()</code>, though the results are sometimes the same. For this input, <code>'3'</code> is returned in both cases. This is a favorite of mine for code golf!</p>
<p><em>Works in Python 2 only!</em></p>
<p><strong>Length 2:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>[]
</code></pre>
<p>An empty list.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>_
</code></pre>
<p>The underscore character is a much-used throwaway variable name. If you are using a Python shell (interactive interpreter), however, it holds the result of the last executed statement (and would return it again.) Also, according to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5893163/underscore-in-python/5893946#5893946">this thread</a>, it is also used for translation lookup in i18n.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong>: Python is a language similar to Java and C. It was built with a specific design philosophy (taken from &quot;<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 20 – The Zen of Python</a>&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
<li>Readability counts</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these, though semi-colons are allowed as a statement delimiter, they are usually omitted in favor of using multiple lines for readability. Also, line indentation is very important!</p>

<h3>Length 15 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>(1,0,'E')[$x%2]
</code></pre>
<p>It is a very short way to output truthy/falsey values if you are asked to determine if <code>$x</code> is even. (or <code>E</code> for error)</p>
<p>It golfs down a <code>switch</code> statement</p>

</code></pre>
<p>It can index the array using modulo. So the basic algorithm is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>$x</code> is even, then <code>$x%2</code> is <code>0</code>, so first element in array is <code>1</code></li>
<li>If <code>$x</code> is odd, then <code>$x%2</code> is <code>1</code>, so first element in array is <code>0</code></li>
<li>Otherwise if <code>$x%2</code> errors, it shows <code>E</code></li>

<h3>Length 14 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a|% t*y|%{$_}

<p>This combines several snippets below into a very powerful feature. Still using <code>%</code> as an alias for <code>foreach-object</code>, we use both of its position-0 positional parameters: <code>-memberName</code> which takes a string and will return the specified member for each object and can take wildcards provided they resolve to a non-ambiguous name (<code>String</code>'s <code>toCharArray</code> in this example); and <code>-process</code> which applies a script-block to each object (<code>{$_}</code> in the example).</p>
<p>The example above is a way to iterate through each character in a string and implicitly output it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 13 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1,1|select -u
</code></pre>
<p>Parameters in PowerShell can both be <em>positional</em> and <em>expanded</em>. Positional meaning if the parameter flag isn't explicitly specified, it can be inferred. For example, <code>Get-Random 10</code> is the same as <code>Get-Random -Maximum 10</code>, because the <code>-Maximum</code> parameter is positional.</p>
<p>Here, we're using the expandable property of parameters. Since <code>-Unique</code> is the only parameter to <code>Select-Object</code> that starts with <code>-u</code>, we don't need to spell out the entirety of the parameter. Both of these features saves tons of bytes.</p>
<p>The output of this snippet, which feeds an <code>[int]</code>-array into the <code>Select-Object</code> cmdlet is <code>1</code>, as an <code>[int]</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 12 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>0xff*2KB-2e6
</code></pre>
<p>PowerShell has some <s>weird</s> special operators that allow large numbers to be written in small number of characters.</p>
<p>The <code>0x</code> unary operator converts characters from hexadecimal to decimal. For example, <code>0xff --&gt; 255</code> or <code>0xbeef --&gt; 48879</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>KB</code> (and <code>MB</code>, <code>GB</code>, <code>TB</code>, and 'PB') unary operators take input on the left and multiply it by <code>1024</code>, <code>1048576</code>, <code>1073741824</code>, <code>1099511627776</code>, or <code>1125899906842624</code>, respectively. For example, instead of <code>[int]::MaxValue</code>, or <code>2147483647</code>, you can write <code>2GB-1</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>e</code> (exponentiation) binary operator basically takes the input on the left and tacks on (the input on the right) number of zeros. For example, <code>2e6 --&gt; 2000000</code>.</p>
<p>The output of this snippet as written is <code>-1477760</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 11 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a=($b=1)+1
</code></pre>
<p>In PowerShell, it's very important to remember that you're dealing with objects on a pipeline. This can be manipulated in several ways, and the above shows the concept of encapsulation. Commands placed in parentheses are executed first (as you'd expect), but the <em>output</em> of the command is left on the pipeline to be picked up later. Here, we're assigning <code>$b</code> to be <code>1</code>, and then assigning <code>$a</code> to be <code>$b+1</code>. This snippet is equivalent to <code>$b=1;$a=$b+1</code>, and shows an easy way to golf bytes anytime you're doing an assignment.</p>
<p>The implications here go beyond just that, however, since it's the PowerShell pipeline and so we're dealing with objects. This means that complex object creations can have nested function or procedure calls, for example calling a constructor and immediately calling a method on the resultant object, and then immediately calling a property on the result. Something like <code>(((New-Object foo).bar()).GetBaz()).baz</code> is perfectly legitimate. In some cases, you don't even need to assign the object to a variable.</p>
<p>Additionally, since anything left on the pipeline is implicitly printed after execution, this means you can accumulate data on the pipeline and print for essentially free. For an easy example, a simple accumulator from 1 to 10 (prints <code>1</code>, then <code>3</code>, then <code>6</code> ...) can be <code>1..10|%{($a+=$_)}</code> vs <code>1..10|%{$a+=$_;$a}</code>, saving a byte, but can save significantly more in other situations. Since we're talking about output, this is a good time to bring up that nearly every output to the console/shell in PowerShell includes a newline (technically <code>\r\n</code> because it's Windows), so if the challenge requires separators we get that for free, too.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 10 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a,$b=1..9
</code></pre>
<p>PowerShell has the capability to do multiple assignment. In the above snippet, <code>$a</code> will be <code>1</code>, an int, while <code>$b</code> will be <code>(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)</code>, an int-array. This has the ability to save lots of bytes if you're looking for particular items -- for example, <code>$a,$b=-split$somestring</code> will split <code>$somestring</code> on whitespace, store the first word in <code>$a</code> and the rest in <code>$b</code>. Very useful if you're looping through a string, for example, or re-manipulating the rest of the string in some fashion.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 9 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>(4,9)[$a]
</code></pre>
<p>PowerShell has very loose type casting. <em>Very</em> loose. We can thus abuse this typecasting to transform array-indexing (as the above) into an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement. For this snippet, if <code>$a</code> will somehow evaluate to a truthy value (a non-zero number, a non-empty string, any other non-<code>$null</code> variable, etc.), the Boolean result will be typecast to a <code>1</code> and so the <code>9</code> will be selected. Conversely, if <code>$a</code> evaluates falsey, the <code>4</code> will be selected. This is PowerShell's <code>x?y:z</code> style ternary if, and is significantly shorter than the equivalent <code>if($a){9}else{4}</code>. It's rare for an actual <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement to show up in PowerShell golfing.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 8 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$c+=++$i
</code></pre>
<p>A simple example showing a couple basic operations. PowerShell has both pre- and post- increment and decrement operators (<code>++</code> and <code>--</code>), and they function pretty much like you'd expect, <em>except</em> when it comes to uninitialized variables. Running the above snippet in a brand-new shell will result in <code>++$i</code> evaluating first as <code>$null + 1 = 1</code> and storing in <code>$i</code>, then adding that result to <code>$c</code> (also <code>$null</code>), which makes <code>$c</code> equal to <code>1</code> as well. Flip the pre-increment to be a post-increment and you get a different result, with <code>$c = 0</code> and <code>$i = 1</code>, <em>but</em> with <code>$c</code> cast as an <code>Int32</code>. This null-arithmetic is a sneaky way of shaving a couple bytes here or there, especially when it comes to not needing to check if a variable already is initialized.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>,'a'*$b
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, so that's a thing. No, really. It's the PowerShell <em>comma operator</em> and it's used to create arrays. As an inline (binary) operator, it creates multi-element arrays, as in <code>$myArray = 1,2,3</code>. As a unary operator, it creates an array with one member, as in <code>$myArray = ,1</code>. In both instances <code>$myArray.GetType()</code> will tell us that it's a <code>System.Array</code> object. Here, we're coupling this with operator overloading (multiplication, specifically) to create an array of length <code>$b</code> with each element equal to <code>'a'</code> -- that is, we can create and pre-populate an array in one go. It's important to note that the array element is evaluated <em>once</em> and then multiplied, so you <em>can't</em> do something fancy like <code>$a=1;$b=5;,($a++)*$b</code> and expect an array <code>1,2,3,4,5</code>. Bummer.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 6 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a-gt2
</code></pre>
<p>OK, pretty simplistic, but this is a continuation of the below concepts. In addition to the usual <code>+-*/</code> operator overloading, PowerShell <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847759.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>comparison</em> operators</a> (<code>-le -eq -gt</code> etc.) are overloaded, too. As are most other &quot;basic&quot; operators.</p>
<p>Let's suppose that <code>$a=3</code>, an int. Then, the above snippet will result in <code>$TRUE</code> as it's comparing &quot;is 3 greater than 2?&quot; So far, so standard. However, let's take <code>$a=(0,1,2,3,4,5)</code> an array of int's from 0 to 5. In this case, the above snippet will result in an array <code>(3,4,5)</code> - that is, it constructed a new array and populated it with all elements of <code>$a</code> that are individually greater than <code>2</code>. Have a constructed array already and want to know how many elements are equal to 0? Try <code>($a-eq0).Count</code>. Want the biggest element in the array that's smaller than a certain value? How about <code>($a-lt4|sort)[-1]</code> (using our &quot;last element&quot; trick from Snippet 4).</p>
<p>This sort of operator overloading continues to other objects, too, not just arrays and ints. <code>$StringA -gt $StringB</code> will categorize the two strings alphabetically. <code>$CharA -gt $CharB</code> calculates based on their ASCII value. And on and on and on. Pretty much any object in PowerShell can be compared like this.</p>
<p>As a bonus, in most cases, if the right-hand operand can be parsed appropriately, you can mix and match types like you can with normal arithmetic operators. As an example, <code>$DateA -lt &quot;2015/12/17&quot;</code> will implicitly parse the right-hand string into a .NET <code>datetime</code> object to calculate comparison.</p>
<p>Combined, the Length 5 and Length 6 snippets allow PowerShell codegolf answers to be <em>very</em> loose with type-casting, which cuts out a tremendous amount of bytes.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a+$b
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;What, really? The <em>plus-sign</em> is what you're showcasing? Phaw!&quot; OK, OK, put down your torches and pitchforks, and hear me out. I'm showcasing operator overloading. &quot;Well, so what, plenty of other languages have that! Plus, you showed that for your Length-1 Snippet!&quot; Yeah, but that needs to also be coupled with PowerShell's powerful implicit casting and implicit parsing.</p>
<p>Operations like the above snippet in PowerShell take on the characteristics of the left-hand side operand. Suppose <code>$a='123'</code> and <code>$b=4</code>, with the first as a string and the second as an int. With the above snippet, the result will be <code>1234</code> as a string. Flip the order <code>$b+$a</code> and PowerShell will implicitly parse the string object to turn it into an int, and the result will be <code>127</code> as an int.</p>
<p>While this is powerful, and allows you to abuse plenty of different operators for nefarious codegolf purposes, it has the <s>quirk</s> feature that operators are not commutative. In other words, <code>($a+$b) -eq ($b+$a)</code> will return <code>False</code> in <em>lots</em> of cases.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>A secret weapon used when indexing arrays or strings or the like to retrieve &quot;the last element.&quot; We don't even need to know the length of the array. Want the second-to-last element? Use <code>[-2]</code> instead. And so on.</p>
<p>One example where this comes in handy is in finding the maximal of a list of numbers. Suppose we previously stored them in <code>$x</code>. PowerShell already has an alias for <code>Sort-Object</code> as <code>sort</code>, thus, we can do <code>($x|sort)[-1]</code> to pull out the maximal item from <code>$x</code>, and we don't even care or know how many items are in <code>$x</code>, and it's significantly shorter than the &quot;regular&quot; method of <code>($x|measure -maximum).Maximum</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>iex
</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>iex</code> is an alias for <code>Invoke-Expresssion</code>, and is similar to an <code>eval()</code> style statement. However, it has implications for codegolf in that it can take parameters <em>or</em> pipeline input (because remember, the pipeline hands off objects, not text).</p>
<p>As a simple example, suppose I need to sum the numbers from 1 to 10. I could write <code>1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10</code>, but at 20 bytes that's pretty lengthy. I know I can get a range of numbers using the <code>..</code> range operator, such as <code>1..10</code>, but now I essentially have an array of integers. I can concatenate them together with the <code>join</code> operator, like so <code>1..10-join'+'</code>, and now I have a string that can be fed into <code>iex</code> as <code>1..10-join'+'|iex</code>, for 17 bytes. This simple example shows how very complex commands can be dynamically constructed rather than hardcoded, but still be executed as if they were coded directly, and can significantly cut down on byte-count.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$_
</code></pre>
<p>This was already introduced below in the Length-1 snippet, but it's important enough to reiterate here. Another strong suit that gives PowerShell advantages in codegolfing is the concept of <em>automatic variables</em>. That is, variables that are implicitly created in the background by the system. Here, the <code>$_</code> variable stands for &quot;the current object in the pipeline.&quot; Essentially, it's a variable that is a dynamic placeholder for whatever object we're currently manipulating.</p>
<p>In the example loop <code>1..1e4|%{$_%5}</code>, the <code>$_</code> variable first holds the integer <code>1</code>, then <code>2</code>, then <code>3</code>, etc. The power is more evident when dealing with a collection of different objects - <code>$_</code> could be a string, an int, a custom PSObject holding the entire Windows System Event Log, a TCP/IP socket object, etc., all dynamically typed as the situation changes.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>%
</code></pre>
<p>The other answer used a pipe <code>|</code> for the Length-1 snippet, and that's probably the most important 1-symbol snippet for 99% of use cases, but the <code>%</code> is functionally way more powerful for codegolf purposes, and introduces two important concepts.</p>
<p>The first is one of PowerShell's hidden codegolf weapons, aliasing, which significantly cuts down code length. Here, the <code>%</code> character is a standard alias for <code>ForEach-Object</code>, and allows us to create loops with very little code overhead.</p>
<p>The second is operator overloading. In PowerShell, as in other languages, the <code>%</code> operator stands for modulo -- <code>3%2</code> will return <code>1</code> as an example. However, thanks to a strongly/weakly typed system (more on that later), and strong syntax requirements, the same character serves double-duty.</p>
<p>For example, <code>1..1e4|%{$_%5}</code> is a loop that will generate and output a <code>123401234012340...</code> string that's 10,000 characters long (with newlines in between, more on that later).</p>
<p>I've already rambled <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62295/42963">at length</a> about the differences between <code>ForEach</code> and <code>ForEach-Object</code>, so I won't redo that here.</p>

<p>Windows PowerShell had its origins over a dozen years ago (and actually just had its 9-year release anniversary; the original release was 14/Nov/2006) as Monad and the Microsoft Shell.

<p><sup><em>Also applies to <a href="https://github.com/easyaspi314/thumbgolf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ThumbGolf</a>, a direct superset of Thumb-2.</em></sup></p>
<p>ARM Thumb-2 is a rather quirky RISC instruction set. It is a 32-bit architecture, but unlike most RISC instruction sets, it uses a mix of 16-bit and 32-bit instructions.</p>
<p>Thumb was originally a 16-bit only subset of the 32-bit ARM instruction set, created in 1998 with the ARM7TDMI. It was designed for embedded devices which either had a 16-bit memory bus or required more code density, and it was pretty impractical otherwise.</p>
<p>In 2003, with the release of the ARM1156T2, this was expanded to a whole new instruction set, named Thumb-2. Combining flexible 32-bit instructions with the existing 16-bit instructions, Thumb-2 was a faster, smaller, and more polished replacement for the old 32-bit ARM instruction set.</p>
<p>ARM is best known for its powerful addressing modes, barrel shifter, <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0489/c/arm-and-thumb-instructions/multiply-instructions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Absolutely Ridiculous Multiplier</a>, load/store multiple, and conditional execution.</p>
<p>Small factoid: Thumb was a key factor in the Game Boy Advance's design. It significantly lowered the cost of Game Paks thanks to both the code density and the cheap memory bus.</p>

<p><code>lsls</code> and <code>lsrs</code> are (likely) the most useful arithmetic instructions out of the original 16-bit instruction set. Many masking operations can be done in half the size with a simple shift right and testing the flags.</p>
<p>This tests if the low bit is set. You can also use this for bitmasks, as <code>lsrs</code> and <code>lsls</code> also set the zero flag.</p>

<div id="pu25" class="pu"><h1>Scala</h1>
<p>Scala is a JVM-based, statically-typed (mostly), hybrid functional/object-oriented language, with type inference, higher kinded types, and generics.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong>: Scala started with the man behind Java generics and a lot of the Java compiler, Martin Odersky.</p>
<h2>1</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>;</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>There isn't much need for semicolons in Scala (unlike its cousin, Java), but they can still be found in some places, such as <code>for</code> statements (also known as &quot;<code>for</code> comprehensions&quot;). For example:</p>
<pre><code>for (i &lt;- 0 to 10;
     a &lt;- 0 to 10
) yield (i, a)
</code></pre>
<p>Will return a list going something like (0, 0), (0, 1)... (1, 9), (2, 0)... (10, 10).</p>
<h2>2</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>()</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Scala's <code>Unit</code> type has only one value: <code>()</code>. Used like Java or C's <code>void</code>. Don't be fooled, though: it's not an empty tuple!
This type is mostly returned from functions with side effects, to distinguish them from the purely functional ones. In Scala, <em>every</em> function <em>must</em> return a value. If they don't, they implicitly return <code>()</code>.</p>
<h2>3</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>???</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>An operator which just throws NotImplementedError. Luckily, thanks to Scala's powerful type system, it can be put in any unimplemented function and still be typesafe:</p>
<pre><code>def notImplemented: Int = ???
def foo: String = ???
</code></pre>
<p>One of the best parts of Scala is that there's very little baked-in as compiler magic, and you can write most of the builtins yourself. Operators are simply functions with names that contain symbols - <code>???</code> itself can be defined as:</p>
<pre><code>def ???: Nothing = throw new NotImplementedError(&quot;an implementation is missing&quot;);
</code></pre>
<h2>4</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>None</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>While Scala does have <code>null</code> as part of the language (as an unfortunate holdover from Java), it also has a pre-made option type, called <code>Option[T]</code>. If an optional value isn't there, its value is <code>None</code>. If a value is optional, make it an <code>Option</code>, and you won't ever have a <code>NullPointerException</code>. You can also implement Option yourself, like so:</p>
<pre><code>sealed trait Option[+T]
case class Some[T](value: T) extends Option[T]
case object None extends Option[Nothing]
</code></pre>
<h2>5</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>(1,2)</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>A 2-tuple (a pair) of integers, 1 and 2. Especially useful for returning multiple values from functions, as well as pattern matching. Observe:</p>
<pre><code>def printPoint(p: (Int, Int)) = p match {
    case (x, y) =&gt; println(&quot;X coordinate: &quot; + x + &quot;, Y coordinate: &quot; + y)
}
printPoint((1,2))
// prints &quot;X coordinate: 1, Y coordinate: 2&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>6</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>()=&gt;()</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>An anonymous function. As a functional language, Scala has first-class language support for anonymous functions. To dissect this snippet, it's a function which:</p>
<p><code>()</code> - Takes no parameters,</p>
<p><code>=&gt;</code> - And returns...</p>
<p><code>()</code> - Unit!</p>
<h2>7</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>s&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>The empty string... with a twist. If you begin and end a string with triple-quotes, you can include unescaped characters inside. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;\n&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Also, a string beginning with <code>s</code> can have interpolated values in it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>val num = 10    
val str = s&quot;There are $num nums&quot;
// str == &quot;There are 10 nums&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It gets better though: with braces, you can put expressions inside!</p>
<pre><code>val str = s&quot;2 + 2 == ${2 + 2}.&quot;
// str == &quot;2 + 2 == 4.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>8</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>Future{}</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p><strong>Futures</strong> are things that will happen or be computed... sometime later. Scala has a lot of different models of concurrency that are each useful in their own way (like the Akka framework), and <code>Future</code>s are one of them. <code>Future{}</code> computes <code>()</code>. Pretty useless, but if I have something really expensive to do, like compute 2 + 2 and multiply that by 5, they're pretty handy:</p>
<pre><code>Future {2 + 2} map {_ * 5)
</code></pre>
<p>They're also great for I/O.
Admittedly, you have to do a couple of imports for this, but they're in the standard library.</p>
<h2>10</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>type N=Int
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>This is a type variable called <code>N</code>, which refers to the type <code>Int</code>. You could now write:</p>
<pre><code>val num: N = 1
</code></pre>
<p>And it would work.</p>
<p>Addendum: I said type &quot;variable&quot;, but these can't vary during runtime. You can use these for some nifty type-level programming like the Heterogeneous List, or HList, which is a List that contain several different types of elements while still being typesafe. If you're interested, watch Daniel Spiewak's &quot;High Wizardry in the Land of Scala&quot;: <a href="http://vimeo.com/28793245" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://vimeo.com/28793245</a>.</p>
<h2>16</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>implicit val a=1 
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Have you ever used a heavyweight dependency injection framework like Guice or Spring? If so, you know that dependency injection is (in essence) supplying objects with their dependencies at construction, so that they can stay loosely coupled. The issue with doing this the easy way is that constructor signatures quickly grow out of control when you start to build large dependency graphs. To fix that, you bring in a DI framework, and soon after, your project has 50k lines of XML. :-(</p>
<p>Now for a seemingly unrelated question: have you ever needed to call a series of functions, all sharing a few parameters? Has that ever become so cluttered that you added an extra class, just to put the parameters in one place?</p>
<p><strong>Implicits</strong> give you a way to inject a value of a particular type in a particular scope into a function call. This way, functions can ask for a value without you needing to explicitly provide it. It's filled in automatically! One of the best parts, and the reason this relates to DI, is that constructors also work with implicits. You can create huge parameter lists in your constructors to keep them loosely coupled, but users of your classes will never have to supply all of the parameters manually (but they can, if they want).</p>
<p>This particular snippet creates an implicit value of type <code>Int</code> in the current scope, with the value of <code>1</code>. If any function calls require an implicit <code>Int</code>, they'll automatically be fed <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>17</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-scala prettyprint-override"><code>({type I[T]=T})#I
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>This is a type lambda (in this case acting like an identity function for types). It's a combination of a type member (mentioned above) (<code>type I[T]</code> declares a type constructor <code>I</code> taking a type parameter <code>T</code> ), a structural type (everything between the braces denotes a type), and a type projection (<code>#I</code> accesses the member <code>I</code> of the structural type in braces).</p>
<p>In Scala 3, this can be expressed much more nicely as <code>[T] =&gt;&gt; T</code>.</p>
<h2>18</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-scala prettyprint-override"><code>list.reduce(_ ^ _)
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Underscores have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/8000903">various uses</a> in Scala. Here, we can use them to define a trivial function more concisely. The <code>_ ^ _</code> is really shorthand for <code>(a, b) =&gt; a ^ b</code>.</p>
<p>The snippet reduces a list of what may be integers by XOR-ing them. <code>reduce</code> is just one of the many useful methods in the standard library. There are many others, such as <code>map</code>, <code>heads</code>, <code>distinct</code>, <code>groupBy</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu26" class="pu"><h1>dotcomma</h1>
<p>Dotcomma is a simple esolang I made, which uses only 4 instructions and <s>is not Turing complete</s> is now Turing complete, due to the addition of a queue for storage.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid:</strong></p>
<p>With only the instructions <code>[.,]</code>, the <code>.</code> and <code>,</code> operators are heavily overloaded. For example, <code>,</code> can take input and output, manage the queue, test the number of times a code block was evaluated, and conditionally evaluate a code block. Which of these occur is decided by what characters precede and follow an operator.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2 snippet:</strong></p>
<p>All dotcomma programs are wrapped in code blocks (<code>[]</code>), so a length 1 snippet is impossible.</p>
<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>
<p>This program does nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[.]
</code></pre>
<p>This program sets its return value to 1. All operators and blocks have a return value, which can be used by other operators and blocks to nest expressions, create loops, or manage the programs's structure. If the <code>.</code> operator is preceded by <code>[</code>, it's return value is <code>1</code>. If followed by a <code>]</code>, it uses its return value as the block's return value.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[,]
</code></pre>
<p>This program would previously take a value from input, and output it. The return value of the <code>,</code> operator would have been taken from input when preceded by <code>[</code>, and outputted if followed by <code>]</code>.</p>
<p>In &quot;modern&quot; dotcomma, this will take a value from the queue, and place it at the end of the queue. For example, given the input <code>6 7 8</code> (input is placed on the queue by default), this program would output <code>7 8 6</code> (final value of the queue is used as output by default).</p>
<p>Like the <code>.</code> operator, <code>,</code> will use its return value as a block's return value if followed by <code>]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[.,]
</code></pre>
<p>This program will output <code>1</code>. As with the second snippet, the <code>.</code>'s return value is set to <code>1</code>. However, because the <code>,</code> operator is preceded by an operator, it will use that operator's return value instead of taking a value from the queue.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[,]]
</code></pre>
<p>This program will take a value from the queue, and place it back on the queue. However, it will have a return value of 0. This is because the <code>,</code> is wrapped in a nested block, and blocks default to a return value of 0 if an operator does not explicitly define one.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[,].]
</code></pre>
<p>This program does the exact same thing as <code>[,]</code>. The <code>.</code> operator, if preceded by <code>]</code>, will set its return value to the sum of the return values of all previous un-separated blocks, which is only one in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[].[],.]
</code></pre>
<p>This will return the -1. The first empty block's return value will be read by <code>.</code>, which returns 0. As a result, the next block will be skipped (a loop that runs 0 times). Because the block preceding the <code>,</code> was never run, its return value will be -1.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[,.][,.].]
</code></pre>
<p>This program uses the <code>.</code> operator's addition capabilities to take the sum of two inputs and use it as the program's exit code. Adding a <code>.</code> to the end of the <code>,</code> operators will prevent them from outputting, as they are no longer followed by <code>]</code>.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>MATL is a <strong>stack-oriented</strong> language based on MATLAB and suitable for code golf. Many functions are similar to those of MATLAB, sometimes with extended funcionality.</p>
<p>To simplify stack handling there are <strong>clipboards</strong>, similar to variables in other languages. An interesting feature is an automatic clipboard that holds the inputs of recent function calls. This often avoids the need to manually copy.</p>
<p>There are different types of functions. Most are <strong>normal functions</strong>, which perform operations on inputs and produce outputs. Other types are stack-handling functions, for duplicating, deleting or moving elements in the stack; and clipboard functions, for copying and pasting elements from the clipboards.</p>

<li>MATL, like MATLAB, has many operations that automatically operate on the contents of an array. Using terminology of other languages, <code>s</code> folds the addition operation over the array.</li>
<li>If the input to <code>s</code> is multidimensional, this function performs the sum along the first non-singleton dimension, as in MATLAB. For example, if the input is a 3×4 array (use <code>;</code> as row separator), the output will be a 1×4 row array (sum along first dimension). If the input is a 1×4 row array, the result will be a 1×1 array (sum along second dimension), which is the same as a number.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Length 2: sum along columns</h3>
<p>So what if we want the sum of each column, even if the input happens to be a row array? The following code (<a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=WHM&amp;input=WzEgMiAzXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it online!</a>) does that:</p>
<pre><code>Xs
</code></pre>
<p>These <strong>two characters</strong> together are the name of a single function, which in this case is &quot;sum along the first dimension&quot;. Functions are always named by either one or two characters, and in the latter case the first character is always <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> or <code>Z</code>.</p>
<p>Another form of forcing the sum to operate along the fixed dimension would be to use the <code>s</code> function with two inputs, and specify the desired dimension as second input (see length-3 snippet).</p>
<h3>Length 3: ternary range</h3>
<pre><code>3$:
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=MyQ6&amp;input=NQoyCjEy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>Many functions can take a variable number of inputs or outputs. Each function has a default number of inputs and outputs, or arity. These default can be modified by means of <strong>meta-functions</strong>. The meta-function <code>$</code> specifies the number of inputs (or even their position in the stack) of the following normal function.</p>
<p>The function <code>:</code> (range) by default takes one input <code>n</code>, and produces its unary range. With three inputs, say <code>i</code>, <code>s</code> and <code>f</code>, it produces an array formed by numbers <code>i, i+s, i+2*s</code>, ... up to the largest integer not exceeding <code>f</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 4: multiplication table</h3>
<p>The code (<a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=OnQhKg&amp;input=MTA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it online!</a>)</p>
<pre><code>:t!*
</code></pre>
<p>produces an <code>n</code>×<code>n</code> multiplicaton table, where <code>n</code> is an input number.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:</code> by default it takes 1 input, and produces the row array <code>[1,2,...,n]</code>.</li>
<li><code>t</code> is a <strong>stack-handling function</strong>. It also takes 1 input by default, and simply duplicates it. Other stack-handling functions are <code>w</code> (swap elements) and <code>b</code> (&quot;bubble up&quot; and element).</li>
<li><code>!</code> is transposition, so the row array at the top of the stack becomes a column array <code>[1;2;...;n]</code>.</li>
<li><code>*</code> corresponds to multiplication. By default it takes two inputs. Like most arithmetic operators, it works <strong>element-wise</strong> with <strong>broadcast</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter means that repetition is implicitly applied along singleton dimensions if needed. In this case, the two arrays have non-matching dimensions <code>1</code>×<code>n</code> and <code>n</code>×<code>1</code>. Thus the first array is implicitly replicated <code>n</code> times along the first dimension, and the second along the first dimension, so that they can be multiplied element-by-element. This produces all &quot;combinations&quot; (in the sense of Cartesian product) of the operation.</p>
<p>The result is a 2D numeric array. Numeric arrays are displayed as numbers separated by spaces with vertical alignment.</p>
<h3>Length 5: display &quot;all&quot; even numbers</h3>
<pre><code>`@EDT
</code></pre>
<p>This uses an <strong>infinite loop</strong>, specifically a &quot;do...while&quot; loop in which the loop condition is always true. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=YEBFRFQ&amp;input=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a> (but kill it immediately).</p>
<p>A &quot;do...while&quot; loop begins with <code>`</code> and ends with <code>]</code>. &quot;End&quot; statements <code>]</code> at the end of the program can be omitted, because the loop is <strong>implicitly closed</strong> in that case.</p>
<p>In a &quot;do...while&quot; loop, when the (possibly implicit) statement <code>]</code> is reached the top of the stack is consumed, and if it's truthy the code proceeds with the next iteration. An array is <strong>truthy</strong> if and only if it is <strong>non-empty</strong> and <strong>all</strong> its elements have <strong>nonzero</strong> real part. In this case a <code>T</code> literal (<code>true</code>, corresponding to a logical <code>1</code>) is pushed at the end of each iterartion, so the loop goes on forever.</p>
<p>The body of the loop pushes the iteration index with <code>@</code>. Note that iteration indices start at <code>1</code>. Then <code>E</code> doubles that number, and <code>D</code> displays it. In this case we cannot rely on implicit display at the end of the program, because this program never ends.</p>
<h3>Length 6: Separate primes from non-primes</h3>
<pre><code>tZp2#)
</code></pre>
<p>This code accepts as input an array of positive integers, and produces two arrays: one with the primes contained in the input, and one with the non-primes. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=dFpwMiMp&amp;input=WzEgMiAzIDQgNSA2IDcgOCA5IDEwXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>The code is based on <strong>logical indexing</strong>, which means using an array of type <code>logical</code> as an index. This works as in MATLAB:  <code>true</code> values in the index specify which entries to use. So for an array <code>[10 20 30 40]</code>, the index <code>[false true false true]</code> refers to the subarray formed by the second and fourth entries, that is, <code>[20 40]</code>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to only pick the primes from the input, the code would be <code>tZp)</code>: duplicate the input (<code>t</code>), check for each entry if it's a prime (<code>Zp</code>), and then use the second array as an index into the first (<code>)</code>).</p>
<p><code>)</code> is one of the several <strong>indexing functions</strong> in MATL. Specifically, it does <strong>reference indexing</strong>, which means extracting elements from an array. (This contrasts with assignment indexing, whereby specified positions of an array are written with new values). The <code>)</code> function, like others used for reference indexing, has a two-output version, which produces the indexed array and the <strong>&quot;complementary&quot; array</strong>, corresponding to the entries not selected by the index. The meta-function <code>#</code> specifies the number of outputs of the following normal function. So in this case <code>2#)</code> produces the primes and then the non-primes in separate arrays.</p>
<h3>Length 7: Separate digits from non-digit characters</h3>
<pre><code>t4Y2m&amp;)
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet is similar to that with length 6, but serves to illustrate two new aspects: predefined literals and meta function <code>&amp;</code>. The code takes a string and separates it into two strings: one formed by the digits and one with the non-digits, maintainig the order they have in the input. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=dDRZMm0mKQ&amp;input=J1RoaXMgc3RyMW5nIGMwbnRhaW5zIDMgZGlnaXRzJw" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p><code>Y2</code> is one of several functions that produce <strong>predefined literals</strong> depending on its numeric input. In this case, <code>4Y2</code> gives the string <code>'0123456789'</code>. Function <code>m</code> takes two inputs by default, and outputs a logical array that contains <code>true</code> for elements of the first input that are present in the second. This is then used as logical index into the original string, which was duplicated (<code>t</code>) at the beginning.</p>
<p><code>2#)</code> would then produce a substring with the digits and then a substring with the remaining characters. But <code>&amp;)</code> can be used instead.</p>
<p>Most functions allow an <strong>alternative</strong> or <strong>secondary default</strong> input/output configuration. <strong>Meta-function <code>&amp;</code></strong> is used for this purpose. For <code>)</code>, using <code>&amp;</code> corresponds to selecting two outputs, so <code>&amp;)</code> is equivalent to <code>2#)</code>. Thus the code produces the stated result.</p>
<p>The meaning of <code>&amp;</code> is function-specific. For example, for <code>:</code> it affects the number of inputs. A way to see this is to display the <strong>function's help</strong> using option <code>-h</code> of the compiler:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; matl -h :
:   vector of equally spaced values
    1--3 (1 / 2);  1
    colon (with three inputs x, y, z produces x:y:z; with two inputs 
    x, y produces x:y). If one input: produces 1:x 
</code></pre>
<p>The line <code>1--3 (1 / 2);  1</code> describes the possible numbers of inputs and outputs. This function takes a variable number of inputs from <code>1</code> to <code>3</code>, and produces <code>1</code> output. The default number of inputs is <code>1</code>, and the effect of <code>&amp;</code> is to change that to <code>2</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 8: filter square-free numbers</h3>
<p>The code</p>
<pre><code>&quot;@YfdA?@
</code></pre>
<p>takes an array of integers and outputs those integers that are square-free. A number is square-free if it can't be divided by a perfect square other than 1. Equivalently, in the prime factor decomposition of a square-free number no prime appears more than once. This code serves to illustrate some <strong>control flow</strong> structures, namely <code>for</code> loops and <code>if</code> branches. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=IkBZZmRBP0A&amp;input=WzEwIDIwIDMwIDQwIDUwIDYwXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>Statement <code>&quot;</code> begins a <strong>for-each loop</strong>: it takes an array as input and iterates over its columns. Within the loop, <code>@</code> pushes the current iteration variable, that is, each column of array. In the present case the input is a row array, so each column is just one number. <code>Yf</code> takes that number and pushes its prime factors. <code>d</code> computes the differences between consecutive elements, so a square-free number will not produce any <code>0</code>. <code>A</code> with a vector as input gives <code>true</code> if all the elements are nonzero. So the output of <code>A</code> tells if the current number is square-free or not.</p>
<p>Following is an <strong>if branch</strong>: <code>?</code> takes an input and if truthy executes the next statements. In this case there is only one statement, <code>@</code>, which pushes the current number (which was found to be square-free).</p>
<p>Control flow structures are normally ended by <code>]</code>. In this case, the two <code>]</code> statements are implicit at the end (as in the length-5 snippet). Using the compiler with the <code>-e</code> option shows the code including the implicit statements, as well as <strong>automatic comments</strong>, which may be useful as a starting point for an explanation of the code, with <strong>indentation</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; matl -e &quot;@YfdA?@

&quot;          % for
  @        % for loop variable
  Yf       % prime factors
  d        % difference
  A        % all
  ?        % if
    @      % for loop variable
           % (implicit) end
           % (implicit) end
           % (implicit) convert to string and display
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 11: Matrix multiplication, manually</h3>
<pre><code>7L&amp;!*Xs6Be!
</code></pre>
<p>This illustrates the use of <strong>multidimensional arrays</strong>. These are a powerful tool, specially when coupled with dimension <strong>permuting</strong>  and broadcasting. The code takes two matrices and computes their matrix product (which could also be computed with the <code>Y*</code> function). <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=N0wmISpYczZCZSE&amp;input=WzEgMiAzOyA0IDUgNl0KWzMgNCA1IDY7IC00IDMgMiAwOyAtNCAtNSA2IDhdIA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>Function <code>7L</code> pushes the predefined literal <code>[2 3 1]</code>, and <code>&amp;!</code> applies that permutation of dimensions to the first (implicit) input. Let this input be an <em>M</em>×<em>N</em> matrix (2D numerical array). The permutation with <code>[2 3 1]</code> means that the 2nd dimension becomes the first, the 3rd becomes the second, and the 1st becomes the third. Since the input is a matrix, its 3rd dimension is actually a <strong>singleton dimension</strong>, that is, the size along that dimension is 1. In fact, any array can be assumed to have arbitrarily many trailing singleton dimensions. So the input matrix can be interpreted as an <em>M</em>×<em>N</em>×1 3D array, which after the permutation becomes an <em>N</em>×1×<em>M</em> array.</p>
<p>Function <code>*</code> takes a second (implicit) input and multiplies it by the previously obtained 3D array. The multiplication is element-wise with broadcast (see length-4 snippet). The second input has size <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>, or equivalently <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>×1, and the result of <code>*</code> has size <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em>. To obtain the matrix product, a sum is carried out along the first dimension using <code>Xs</code>. Note that the first dimension of the <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em> array corresponds to columns of the first matrix and rows of the second matrix. The result of <code>Xs</code> has size 1×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em>.</p>
<p><code>6B</code> pushes 6 in binary, that is, the logical array <code>TTF</code> (or <code>[true true false]</code>). Then <code>e</code> is applied to collapse the first two dimensions of the 1×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em> array. This works as follows. <code>e</code> is used for <strong>reshaping</strong> arrays, and takes two inputs by default. With a logical array as second input, it collapses consecutive dimensions of the first input that have the same logical value in the second. So in this case it collapses the first and second dimensions, producing a <em>P</em>×<em>M</em> matrix.</p>
<p>Finally <code>!</code> transposes the matrix to yield the <em>M</em>×<em>P</em> final result.</p>
<h3>Length 12: show a simple image</h3>
<p>The code</p>
<pre><code>:i:!+t0)/3YG
</code></pre>
<p>takes two inputs and shows the following image (example for inputs <code>200</code>, <code>150</code>). Try it at <a href="https://matl.suever.net/?code=%3Ai%3A%21%2Bt0%29%2F3YG&amp;inputs=200%0A150&amp;version=19.7.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MATL online!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JlWX5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JlWX5.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p><code>:</code> takes an input <code>w</code> and generates the row vector <code>[1 2 ... w]</code>. <code>i:!</code> takes a second input <code>h</code> and produces the column vector <code>[1; 2; ...; h]</code>. <code>+</code> creates an <code>h</code>×<code>w</code> matrix with all pair-wise additions.</p>
<p><code>t0)</code> creates a copy of the matrix and extracts its last element. This uses <strong>linear indexing</strong>: a single index is used to access a two-dimensional array (matrix) in <strong>column-major</strong> order, i.e. down, then across. So for a <code>2</code>×<code>3</code> array the linear indices would be</p>
<pre><code>1 3 5
2 4 6
</code></pre>
<p>The index is interpreted in <strong>modular</strong> sense. This means that indices out of bounds are interpreted cyclically. The period of the cycle is the size of the indexed dimension; or, for linear indexing, the total number of elements of the array. So in the <code>2</code>×<code>3</code> example a linear index <code>8</code> is the same as <code>2</code>. <code>0</code> always corresponds to the last value in linear order, that is, last column and last row.</p>
<p>Thus <code>t0)</code> is the last element of the <code>h</code>×<code>w</code> matrix of pair-wise additions. By construction, this is the largest value. So the following <code>/</code> normalizes the array to maximum value <code>1</code>. Finally, <code>YG</code> is a function for <strong>displaying or saving images</strong>. It takes two inputs by default, and the last input specifies what the function actually does. <code>3</code> means that the function displays the matrix (first input) with each entry corresponding to one pixel on the screen, using a grey colormap by default.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu28" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/ZippyMagician/Arn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Arn</a></h1>
<p>Arn is a golfing language I designed recently. It's a functional paradigm with variable-based storage, and has a few cool features I enjoy. The full syntax can be found by clicking the name at the top of this post. An online interpreter can be found <a href="https://zippymagician.github.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for those interested.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<h2>Type casting</h2>
<p>Arn will automatically cast types based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays casting to Strings or Ints will take the 0th element.</li>
<li>Strings or Ints casting to Arrays will split on every character OR every space if there are any.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The variable <strong>_</strong> will be automatically assumed in any place where one a value is missing but required.</p>
<p>Similarly, any closing <strong>)</strong>, <strong>]</strong>, <strong>}</strong>, <strong>&quot;</strong>, <strong>'</strong>, or <strong>`</strong> can be ignored if it reaches the end of an expression or the program.</p>
<h2>STDIN</h2>
<p>STDIN will automatically be assigned to the variable <strong>_</strong> at runtime. It will be a string if STDIN is one line, or an array split on newlines otherwise.</p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Since functions exist in this language, and that means a <strong>Standard Library</strong> can exist! You will see example functions for that later.</p>
<h2>Packing</h2>
<p>In order to help <strong>Arn</strong> compete with other, golfing languages, a packed form exists. This form is shorter, encoded based on a modified <strong>CP1252</strong> found <a href="https://github.com/ZippyMagician/Arn/wiki/Carn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. The average compression rate, as far as I've found, is ~17%.</p>
<p>I am very happy with the encoding, I spent hours and hours on it. It may change to become every more concise in the future (if possible, and if I can figure out how) but until then, this will be how it works.</p>
<p>The interpreter can run <strong>Carn</strong> (Compressed Arn) and regular <strong>Arn</strong> without any indication of which is passed.</p>
<h2>Compressed Strings</h2>
<p>Should be pretty self explanatory. They are based on a dictionary found <a href="https://github.com/ZippyMagician/Arn/blob/master/src/dictionary.js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code is <code>F * 100 + S</code> OR <code>F * 100</code>, depending on if 1 valid compressed character or 2 are passed. Compressed strings are denoted with either <strong>'</strong> or <strong>`</strong>, where the former capitalized every word and the latter just the first. You can find a full description on the GitHub page, linked at the top of the post.</p>
<h1>Showcase</h1>
<p>From top to bottom.</p>
<h2>1 byte</h2>
<pre><code>_
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very simple program, it will just return STDIN. Output is implicit in this language.</p>
<h2>2 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>+4
</code></pre>
<p>This program will add 4 to STDIN and return it. The same as saying <code>_ + 4</code></p>
<h2>3 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>4,7
</code></pre>
<p>Above features the use of an infix; specifically, the <strong>,</strong> infix. This infix is the pair verb; it takes the left and right argument, turning them into an array.</p>
<h2>5 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>.fact
</code></pre>
<p>This little snippet shows us two new features (three, really!): the <strong>.</strong> infix, the <strong>fact</strong> function, and implicit casting. Since no value is passed to the <strong>.</strong> fix, it assumes <strong>_</strong> on the left. This is then passed to the factorial function. The factorial function uses the <strong>1-range</strong> fix, which takes an integer, and so <strong>_</strong> is automatically casted to an integer.</p>
<h2>7 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>+{+1}\~
</code></pre>
<p>This showcases the extremely useful <code>\</code> prefix. This prefix operates as both a fold and map fix; it will map using the block preceding it (if provided) and then fold with the fixes preceding <em>that</em>. This snippet also shows the <strong>1-range</strong> fix, <code>~</code>, in action.</p>
<p>Essentially, this program takes a number on STDIN. It creates a range, from [1, n] (where n is the input). Then it maps over this range, incrementing each entry by one. Finally, it adds all of the entries together.</p>

<p>I know the restriction is relaxed now but I &quot;wanted&quot; to follow the old rules, because 1. I'm lazy 2. I want people to care about it</p>
<p>And yes I do have more (currently hidden from the rest of the wrodl) snippets I'll post them if you upvote</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>1+ is a fun deque-based language (although it's often referred to as a stack-based language). <code>1</code> is the only literal and, furthermore, we only have <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> but not <code>-</code> or <code>/</code>, which makes some 1+ programs fairly hard to write. (Or probably I'm just not particularly clever whatever) It's still, however, easier to use than most Turing tarpits.</p>
<h3>1 byte</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>The only literal in 1+. Almost no program can be built without it.</p>
<h3>2 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>1+
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, language name! It increments the top of the stack. This is where the name of the 1+ chatroom, &quot;increment&quot;, come from. It's non-trivial to decrement the top of the stack, however.</p>
<h3>3 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;&lt;*
</code></pre>
<p>Damn community wiki, I don't even know when I was upvoted... until now.</p>
<p>This snippet features the <code>&lt;</code> operator. It's the only comparison operator in 1+, and returns the boolean value <code>a &lt;= b</code> (where <code>b</code> is the stack top and <code>a</code> is the number behind it). Also, <code>&quot;</code> duplicates the top of the stack and <code>*</code> multiplies the top two numbers.</p>
<p>This snippet pops the stack if the stack have at least 2 numbers. (It is impossible to get back to an empty stack without outputting.) Because <code>a &lt;= a</code> is always true it replaces the stack top with <code>1</code>. Then the multiply operator get rid of that 1 since <code>a * 1 = a</code>.</p>
<h3>4 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>1+1&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>Inverts the top of stack. (That is, if the stack top is 0 replace it with 1, otherwise replace it with 0.) This actually turned out to be quite useful in some places, for example dealing with 1+ control flow.</p>
<p>It works by computing <code>a + 1 &lt;= 1</code> and not <code>a &lt;= 0</code> since pushing a zero is 5 bytes <code>11+1&lt;</code>.</p>
<h3>5 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>(|())
</code></pre>
<p>Infinite recursion. This is a function definition, but functions are executed once when they are declared in 1+ (very golfing-friendly).</p>
<p>The function declaration syntax in 1+ is <code>(name|code)</code> and it is called with <code>(name)</code>. Here the name of the function is empty and it calls itself repeatedly.</p>
<h3>7 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>(|&quot;&lt;##)
</code></pre>
<p>I don't have anything for 6 bytes, so here you go. This is a pop function that works anywhere (unless the stack is empty, of course). It's here to showcase the <code>#</code> instruction (The only other place I remember using this function is the input template) which is the only type of control flow. It pops a number n, and jumps to the instruction after the nth <code>#</code>. (It is 0-indexed, which is sometimes really annoying when golfing but sometimes, <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/208961/87986">not so much.</a>)</p>
<p>Functions creates &quot;seperate lines of execution&quot; according to original specs - this confuses lots of readers! Interpreter-wise, when executing a function, the interpreter calls itself. This means all <code>#</code> outside the function are ignored and the indexing starts from 0 again. (And all <code>#</code> inside the functions are ignored in the main line, that's what was meant by seperate lines of execution.)</p>
<p>This snippet creates a function with an empty name (because functions are executed once when they are declared, there are no need to call it). New function definitions overrides old definitions, so it will always work.</p>
<p><code>&quot;&lt;</code> replaces the top number with 1, the original value doesn't matter, much like the 3 byte snippet. The following <code>#</code> pops a number, in this case it is 1, and jumps to the second <code>#</code> (don't forget it's 0-indexed!) so the 1 is gone. Then we reached the end of the function.</p>

<h1>Zsh</h1>

<p>Zsh may seem like a new language, given the (relatively) recent popularity of the "Oh My Zsh" framework,
but it in fact dates back to 1990, just one year after Bash released.
Zsh's syntax is inspired by the bourne shell and ksh.</p>

<p>Many people are familiar with Bash scripting, but don't understand how Zsh differs. Zsh brings a surprising amount of powerful constructs.
I'll be highlighting these differences here.</p>

<h2>Length 1 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>:
</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to the command <code>true</code>. It returns zero (truthy in shell scripts).
Uses for this include short bodyless <code>for</code> loops: <code>for ((x;y;z)):</code></p>

<h2>Length 2 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$a
</code></pre>

<p>Parameter expansion. If <code>a</code> is set to some value, substitute that value.</p>

<p>Unlike in Bash and POSIX shells, if <code>$a</code> is an array, this will expand to all <em>non-empty</em> elements
(or, in the language of shells, "words") of <code>$a</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 3 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$=s
</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to the expansion <code>${=s}</code>, which induces word splitting.
For parameter expansion forms that involve a prefix (except for flags, see below) or modifiers (see below)
the surrounding braces can be removed if unambiguous.</p>

<p>Unlike in Bash and POSIX shells, word splitting is <em>not</em> done on parameters by default.
To split on <code>$IFS</code>, this construct is needed, or the option <code>shwordsplit</code> needs to be set.</p>

<h2>Length 4 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>*(.)
</code></pre>

<p>When expanding globs, Zsh supports <em>glob qualifiers</em> specified in parentheses after the glob.
Appending <code>(.)</code> as above will cause this glob to expand to all regular files in the directory.
There are dozens of globbing qualifiers, here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/</code>: Directories</li>
<li><code>F</code>: Non-empty directories</li>
<li><code>@</code>: Symlinks</li>
<li><code>U</code>: Files owned by the effective UID</li>
<li><code>Yn</code>: When <code>n</code> is a number, expand to the first <code>n</code> matches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 5 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>${~x}
</code></pre>

<p>This will expand <code>x</code> as a <em>glob</em>.
This is useful to match filenames, match <code>case</code> expressions, and in <code>[[</code> tests.</p>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>${s:l}
</code></pre>

<p>Zsh supports various <em>modifiers</em> to parameter expansion.
The <code>l</code> modifier will lowercase all words of <code>s</code>.
The equivalent construct in bash is <code>"${s,,}"</code> (or if <code>s</code> is an array: <code>"${s[@],,}"</code>.</p>

<p>Other useful modifiers include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>a</code>: Turns paths into absolute paths</li>
<li><code>A</code>: Turns paths into absolute paths with symlinks resolved</li>
<li><code>s/foo/bar</code>: Does replacement on each element. Use <code>gs/foo/bar</code> for global replacement.</li>
<li><code>&amp;</code>: Repeat the previous substitution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 7 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>${(i)@}
</code></pre>

<p>Zsh also supports roughly 30 parameter expansion <em>flags</em>.
The <code>i</code> flag will sort the parameters case-insensitively.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>k</code>: Substitute the array keys instead of values</li>
<li><code>P</code>: Induce indirect parameter expansion: if <code>a='b'</code> and <code>b='c'</code>, then <code>${(P)a}</code> expands to <code>'c'</code></li>
<li><code>q</code>: Quote characters special to the shell with backslashes or <code>$'\NNN'</code>. <code>q-</code> and <code>q+</code> will use different methods for quoting.</li>
<li><code>u</code>: Remove duplicate words in the expansion.</li>
<li><code>z</code>: Split into words according to shell parsing grammar: if <code>c='"a b" c'</code>, then <code>${(z)c}</code> will split into <code>"a b"</code> <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 8 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>xy${^a}z
</code></pre>

<p>With this expression, if <code>a</code> is some array (e.g.: <code>a=(hello world)</code>),
<code>a</code> is converted to a brace expansion (e.g.: <code>xyhelloz</code> <code>xyworldz</code></p>

<h2>Length 9 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;${str}
</code></pre>

<p>Like in bash, this is a <em>here-string</em>.
Unlike in bash, if no command is provided, the string is printed to stdout.
This can often be used as a replacement for <code>echo</code>,
except that the expansion of <code>${str}</code> occurs in a subshell.</p>

<h2>Length 10 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$a[(r)a?*]
</code></pre>

<p>Array subscripts also have flags! <code>r</code> is "reverse subscripting":
This will give the first word in <code>a</code> whose value matches <code>a?*</code>. (Likewise, <code>R</code> gives the last match.)</p>

<p>Other flags include <code>i</code> and <code>I</code> which <em>return</em> the indices or keys of the match,
<code>k</code> and <code>K</code> which <em>match</em> the keys, or <code>w</code> or <code>f</code> which split scalar <code>a</code> on words or lines, respectively.</p>

<h2>Length 11 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>b=(${@:*a})
</code></pre>

<p>This is another form of parameter expansion, it will expand to all words of <code>"$@"</code> that exist in the array <code>a</code>.
Similarly, <code>${@:|a}</code> will expand to the words of <code>$@</code> which do <em>not</em> exist in <code>a</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 12 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>${${(f)s}:h}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Zsh is that parameter expansions can be <em>indefinitely nested</em>.
So this will take <code>s</code>, split it on newlines, and then strip each line's the last path component. (<code>/usr/bin/zsh</code> ⇒ <code>/usr/bin</code>)</p>

<h2>Length 13 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$argv[i,i+10]
</code></pre>

<p>The numbered parameters <code>$@</code> can also be found under the named array <code>argv</code>.
For some purposes, this can be more convenient or more consistent if also working with other arrays.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get a substring or non-associative array.
The <code>${name:offset:length}</code> method works the same way in Bash,
but the <code>$name[start,end]</code> method is different:
The subscripts use <em>arithmetic expansion</em>, like you'd find in <code>$[ ]</code> or <code>$(( ))</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 15 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>print -P %D{%F}
</code></pre>

<p>Like Bash's <code>PS1</code> sequences, Zsh has its own prompt sequences.
<code>%D</code> expands to the current date, with an optional <code>{</code>string<code>}</code> after it.
That string will be passed to <code>strftime</code> to be expanded.</p>

<p>Variables can also be prompt-expanded with the <code>%</code> expansion flag: <code>${(%)foo}</code></p>

<h2>Length 16 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;$[[#16]8#755]
</code></pre>

<p>Arithmetic expansion supports any base from 2-36 (inclusive).
<code>n#...</code> will interpret the number at that base, while <code>[#n]</code> will return the number in that base.</p>

<p>The number will be printed as <code>base#number</code> (this example: <code>16#351</code>) with the exception of certain options and bases:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>setopt nocbases</code>: No special cases</li>
<li><code>setopt cbases</code>: Base 16 numbers will be printed as <code>0x[num]</code></li>
<li><code>setopt cbases octalzeroes</code>: Base 8 numbers will also be printed as <code>0[num]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With <code>setopt octalzeroes</code>, numbers with leading zeroes in arithmetic expansions will be interpreted as octal,
without needing the <code>8#</code> prefix.</p>

<h2>Length 19 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>setopt extendedglob
</code></pre>

<p>This deserves a post on its own...
This option adds a lot of new globbing options.
It's like changing from EREs to PCREs, but with globs.
I've started submitting <code>zsh -oextendedglob</code> as a language for some challenges.</p>

<h2>Length 29 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>for x y (${a:^^b})c+=$[$#x+y]
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, there's a lot here. This will:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>${a:^^b}</code>: Zip the arrays together, looping the shorter of the two arrays.</li>
<li><code>for x y (...)</code>: Pull words out two at a time, assigning them to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></li>
<li><code>b+=($[$#x+y])</code>: Add the length of <code>x</code> to the value of <code>y</code>, and append that to <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because only one operation is done for each iteration of the loop, no <code>{</code> <code>}</code> or <code>do</code> <code>done</code> is needed.</p>

<div id="pu33" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Keg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Keg</a></h1>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Keg is a stack-based golfing language, created by PPCG user <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/78850/jono-2906">Lyxal</a>, that focuses on simplicity and readability. It is fairly unique compared to most other golfing-based languages, since it has few instructions, and alpha-numeric characters are automatically pushed to the stack. It also has implicit input and output.</p>
<h3>Length One</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>An example of the stack controls in Keg. This rolls the stack, which puts the top of the stack to the bottom. It is the opposite of <code>'</code>, which rolls the stack in the opposite direction, putting the bottom of the stack at the top.</p>
<h3>Length Two</h3>
<pre><code>ab
</code></pre>
<p>Since these are alpha-numeric characters, they get auto-pushed to the stack as their respective ASCII values, which in this case are 97 and 98.</p>
<h3>Length Two (bytes)</h3>
<pre><code>ߞ
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is not an instruction, this will be pushed onto the stack automatically. Keg allows Unicode characters to be pushed onto the stack, so this pushes 2014.</p>
<h3>Length Three</h3>
<pre><code>83*
</code></pre>
<p>Any numbers get auto-pushed to the stack. In this case, it pushes 8, then pushes 3, and then multiplies them, giving 24.</p>
<h3>Length Four</h3>
<pre><code>¿:+.
</code></pre>
<p>This shows how duplicating items and integer printing works by using nice input (evaluation of input) to double the given number.</p>
<h3>Length Five</h3>
<pre><code>[a|b]
</code></pre>
<p>An example of an if statement in Keg. When an if statement is run, the top item of the stack is popped. If it is non-zero, the left code is run, whilst if it is zero, the right on the right is run. Note that the right side is optional</p>
<h3>Length Six</h3>
<pre><code>(56*|1
</code></pre>
<p>An example of a for loop in Keg. The number on the left side is how many times it'll run, whilst the code on the right is what's run. In this case, it pushes 1 to the stack 30 times. If the left side isn't specified, it will automatically be the length of the stack. Also, all ending brackets get automatically completed at the end of the program, making this valid.</p>
<h3>Length Seven</h3>
<pre><code>{!4&gt;|.}
</code></pre>
<p>An example of a while loop in Keg. The code on the left is the condition, and the code on the right is what's run. In this case, while the length of the stack is greater than 4, it outputs the top element of the stack as an integer.</p>
<h3>Length Eight</h3>
<pre><code>\ 
&amp; &amp;:.&amp; 
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates a unique features of escaping characters and accumulator usage. The \ instruction escapes the newline, which has an ASCII value of 10, then the accumulator is set to 10. After that, the accumulator value will be accessed and printed, resulting in the program printing 10.</p>
<h3>Length Nine</h3>
<pre><code>`Snippet`
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates the usage of strings in Keg. It pushes the string &quot;snippet&quot; and prints it.</p>
<h3>Length Eleven</h3>
<pre><code>^!~$%(_|&quot;)_
</code></pre>
<p>This showcases most of the commands in one concise program. This removes exactly 1 character from 1 line of input randomly.</p>
<h3>Length Twelve</h3>
<pre><code>@d1|:+ƒ¿@dƒ.
</code></pre>
<p>This defines a function called <code>d</code> and assigns the code <code>:+</code> to it (doubling the input passed to it). Nice input is then taken (<code>¿</code>) and <code>d</code> is called on the input.</p>

<div id="pu34" class="pu"><h2><a href="https://github.com/a-ee/w" rel="nofollow noreferrer">W</a></h2>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>W is a simple stack-based golfing language that is surprisingly very concise. Its powerful iterator protocol and implicit input system is the cause for this.</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>w
</code></pre>

<p>This is in fact a valid Truth-machine program (infinite 1 while 1). Let's explain it. The first step of the execution is to prepend all of the possible inputs to the stack:</p>

<pre><code>aaw
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the input is used both as the condition and as the body of the while loop. Therefore this program decodes to the following pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>while the input:
    print the input
</code></pre>

<p>The print is implicit in every while iteration. So if the input is <code>1</code> (a truthy value), this prints the input <code>1</code> indefinitely.</p>

<p>You might want to ask, could this code snippet produce the right result for a 0 input? Yes; the while loop returns the condition onto the stack after the execution, therefore 0 is outputted onto the stack.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE.</strong> W's while loop is only for demonstration purposes. Never use this instruction, because W is designed to allow users to use for loops over while loops.</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>+M
</code></pre>

<p>The W snippet that I am most proud of! It showcases more of W's powerful protocol.</p>

<p>So let us first try to make <code>'z'</code> (the string) as an input. The program outputs:</p>

<pre><code>aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz
</code></pre>

<p>Well, you might be confused by this odd output. Don't worry; I will explain it.</p>

<pre><code>aaa+M
</code></pre>

<p>This transpiles to:</p>

<pre><code>map(a,a+a)
</code></pre>

<p>Which means double every item in the string. If the string was <code>'ab'</code> then the output would be <code>'aabb'</code>.</p>

<p>So, <em>why in the world</em> would it return the doubled alphabet? Well, the <code>M</code>ap instruction has an automatic range that allows users to iterate over a singleton. (Because it is pointless to do so)</p>

<p>In this context, this will return a range from lowercase <code>a</code> to <code>z</code>, hence the doubled alphabet.</p>

<p>Control flow is currently handled using gotoes, evaluated gotoes, and conditionals.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong> <code>0</code></p>

<p>A number literal for the rational number <code>0/1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong>: <code>io</code></p>

<p>The <code>io</code> namespace contains the language's console and file IO functionality. GUI IO is located in a separate namespace.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong> <code>nil</code></p>

<p>A constant field containing the null reference.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong> <code>0xFF</code></p>

<p>A <em>hexadecimal</em> number literal for the rational number <code>255/1</code> (hexadecimal literals can only be used for integers).</p>

<p>Hex literals are useful as color codes for the language's (currently somewhat limited) graphics library.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong> <code>11/13</code></p>

<p>A number literal for the rational number 11/13, which is stored exactly as a BigRational.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong> <code>!!TRUE</code></p>

<p>Obviously, this returns TRUE.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet:</strong> <code>def a a</code></p>

<p>An abuse of the <code>def</code> instruction that causes any subsequent attempts to evaluate the expression <code>a</code> to result in an infinite loop.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 snippet:</strong> <code>gui.show</code></p>

<p>A method that produces a simple gui alert.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong> <code>math.sqrt</code></p>

<p>Estimates the square root of a number as another BigRational. It does this by doing some math to find an integer which approximates this value, then applying four iterations of the Babylonian Method to this initial approximation.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong> <code>random.rand</code></p>

<p>The function <code>random.rand</code> can be used to produce random numbers on <code>[0, (2^m-1)/(2^m)]</code> for arbitrary positive integer values of <code>m</code> (effectively on <code>[0,1)</code> as <code>m</code> becomes large). When called with no arguments (<code>random.rand()</code>) it uses <code>m=80</code>.</p>

What it's really doing is accessing the default value of the variable-without-a-name; more on variables later, once we have larger pyramids.</p>

<p>Exactly as before, but now with a leading blank line! This program does nothing; it is the shortest possible program of the sort. Execution in Pyramid Scheme always begins on the first line. Each pyramidion on that first line is evaluated, and then the results are printed with linefeeds between if nothing has yet been printed. As the first line here is blank, nothing gets evaluated or printed.</p>

<p>On the other end, here's a program with more than one pyramid at the top. The one on the left will be evaluated first (yielding 0, as in the length-3), followed by that on the right. The results are collected in a list during execution; once all evaluation is complete, since nothing has yet been printed, the results are dumped to stdout:</p>

<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Scratch</a> is a graphical programming language created by MIT. Because it's graphical and block-based, rather than counting the number of characters, I'm going to count the number of blocks (after all, the number of characters could change with translations).</p>

<p>Rather than getting a screen shot of every single script I'll give you a link to a <a href="http://scratchblocks.github.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Scratchblocks</a> page. I'll also post the code for it below.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>when [space v] key pressed
set [Playing? v] to [1]
set [Score v] to [0]
reset timer

when this sprite clicked
if &lt;(Playing?) = [0]&gt;
  change [Score v] by [1]
end

when [timer v] &gt; (10)
set [Playing? v] to [0]
</code></pre>

<p>Well, we've got three whole scripts here! This should be simple enough to understand, but I'll explain it anyways.</p>

<pre><code>when [space v] key pressed
set [Playing? v] to [1]
set [Score v] to [0]
reset timer
</code></pre>

<p>When the space key is pressed, we want to set the playing variable to 1 (e.g. true), the score variable to 0 (e.g. no points yet), and <strong>reset the timer.</strong> The timer is an important part of this project!</p>

<pre><code>when this sprite clicked
if &lt;(Playing?) = [0]&gt;
  change [Score v] by [1]
end
</code></pre>

<p>When the sprite is clicked on, if we are currently playing, change the score by 1.</p>

<pre><code>when [timer v] &gt; (10)
set [Playing? v] to [0]
</code></pre>

<p>When the timer is greater than 10 (e.g. 10 seconds have elapsed since the timer has last been reset) set the playing variable to 0. Because it is now 0, in the when-sprite-clicked script the score is no longer increased.</p>

<p>By the way, here is the costume that the sprite uses:</p>

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key bit of information about this project is that you can have multiple scripts inside a single project. Each of these scripts will be called according to their hat block, so <code>when this sprite clicked</code> will happen when this sprite is clicked on!</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Getting a bit technical here, but <strong>Scratch does not use multiple threads.</strong> Instead you should think of scripts being stuck into a list of things to do. It's a bit complicated but works similarly to the way JavaScript does.</p>
    
    <p>Also, keep in mind that many blocks will automatically update the screen (as well as control events, for example, a loop looping) and will tell Scratch's interpreter to go on to the next script occurring simultaneously. You can get around this by putting your script inside of a run-without-screen-refresh custom block as shown in length 8.</p>

<p>What's so nice about Scratch is that it's scripts are <em>very</em> self-explanatory. I probably don't even need to explain to you what this does for you to figure it out (especially if you run the program by going to the above link).</p>

<p>However, this example does introduce a few new things I haven't shown yet:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sprites:</strong> These are Scratch's idea of <em>things</em> in the world (stage). A sprite is generally what you use when you want to add a character to your scene. Whenever you <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open up the editor</a>, you already get pre-loaded a sprite - it's that scratch cat! You can use as many sprites as you want in your program as well. Learn more about Sprites and how to create them on the <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Sprite" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broadcasts:</strong> A broadcast is as it sounds (literally) - it's a message that is sent through the project to every single sprite in the program. You use the <strong>when I receive</strong> hat to make something happen when a script is broadcasted. Broadcasts are a very important part of the programming language and you can learn more about them on the wiki <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Broadcast" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One last cool thing about this project is that if you change the numbers in the <code>go to x: y:</code> block it will always work - so why not try it?</p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>Swift is a compiled language created by Apple, introduced in 2014 and is meant to replace Objective-C, the first supported language for OSX and iOS. Swift is currently used for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS development. It uses the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LLVM Compiler</a></strong></p>

<p>It focuses on writing less code (compared to Objective-C, which is very verbose) and handling safer types.
It features type inference, first-class type functions, closures, optional types, enum associated values and many more.</p>

<p>Swift is REPL, you can make your own idea by trying it on <del><a href="http://swiftstub.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://swiftstub.com/</a></del>, or <del><a href="http://www.runswiftlang.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.runswiftlang.com</a></del> (these sites were shut down), use <del><a href="https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl</a></del> instead.<br>

<h2>Snippets:</h2>

<h2>• <em>14</em></h2>

<pre><code>case let(8,x):
</code></pre>

<p>In a switch case, this statement is absolutely correct.<br>
That switch must have a tuple with two values. When evaluating the expression, if the first value is <code>8</code>, it enters the case and fills the <code>x</code> variable with the second value of the tuple so you can access it directly inside the case.</p>

<h2>• <em>11</em></h2>

<pre><code>/** #YES */
</code></pre>

<p>In Swift 2.0, comments can be written in Markdown. This produces a big title with <strong>YES</strong> as text. It can be displayed with format in the help navigator or quick help in Xcode.</p>

<h2>• <em>10</em></h2>

<pre><code>var i=10e8
</code></pre>

<p>It creates a double value with <code>1000000000.0</code> in it. You can even write it like this <code>1_000_000_000.0</code>. Swift accepts different number notations for scientific or currency purposes. It all leads to the same value in memory, but helps to clarify source code.</p>

<h2>• <em>9</em></h2>

<pre><code>f(#i:int)
</code></pre>

<p>When declaring a function, you have to name the formal and the actual parameter, but sometimes the actual parameter name is already a good formal parameter name. Instead of writing the name twice at declaration <code>func myFunc(aMarvelousInt aMarvelousInt: int)</code> you put a hash symbol in front of the parameter <code>func myFunc(#aMarvelousInt: int)</code>.<br>
This feature has been removed from Swift 2.0 because it's the default behavior. To prevent using the variable name as a method label, insert an underscore and a space before the variable name <code>func myFunc(_ aMarvelousInt: int)</code></p>

<h2>• <em>8</em></h2>

<pre><code>Array&lt;T&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Swift have generics, you can only insert objects of the specified type. The short notation of that array is <code>[T]</code>. In case you want to insert different types in an array, you must specify the type <code>AnyObject</code>, or <code>Any</code> if you don't insert <code>NSObject</code>s inside.</p>

<h2>• <em>7</em></h2>

<pre><code>let π=3
</code></pre>

<p>This declares a constant <code>π</code> containing a approximation of pi. In Swift, source code is in <strong>Unicode</strong>. Your variable names can even contain emojis <code>😃🚀🐑</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>6</em></h2>

<pre><code>"\(i)"
</code></pre>

<p>This returns a <code>String</code> with the value of <code>i</code> in it. The backslash escape character followed by a value in parentheses evaluates the content and inserts it in the string, or if it's a <code>printable</code> object, it uses its <code>description</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>5</em></h2>

<pre><code>(3,7)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a tuple with two integers. Tuples can be used to make functions return several values. To get the values, you specify the index. <code>(3,7).1</code> returns <code>7</code>. You can also name the values at declaration and access them with an identifier. <code>(hours: 12, minutes: 46, meridiem: "PM").minutes</code> returns <code>46</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>4</em></h2>

<pre><code>func
</code></pre>

<p>That's the way to declare functions. A function is a first class object.</p>

<h2>• <em>3</em></h2>

<pre><code>let
</code></pre>

<p>That's the way you declare constants. Constants have an optimisation in the compilation phase compared to the <code>var</code> declarations. An example is <code>let hoursInADay = 24.0</code>. Type inference makes that constant a <code>Double</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>2</em></h2>

<pre><code>..
</code></pre>

<p>This was the operator for half opened range in Swift 1.0, but to avoid ambiguity with the closed range operator <code>...</code>, it has been replaced with <code>..&lt;</code> in Swift 1.1</p>

<p>You can use them in for loops (<code>for x in 0..&lt;5</code>), on in switch cases (<code>case (0..&lt;5): break</code>)</p>

<h2>• <em>1</em></h2>

<pre><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>All Semicolons are facultative, until you put more than one instruction in a line.</p>

First, <code>~</code>, when used functionally, reverses the operands given to a function. So, for example, <code>(~V)[1, 2, 3]</code> would be called as <code>V[3, 2, 1]</code>, which gives <code>[3, 2, 1]</code>. <code>~</code> has the effect of reversing the order in which abstracts are called. The above function could be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>{-_2'_}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <code>'</code> operator, when used on data, concatenates them. Since <code>-</code> is unary, it negates <code>_2</code>. This is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>{ [ -_2, _1 ] }
</code></pre>

<p>Assign it as <code>f</code>, and <code>f[1, 2]</code> becomes <code>[-2, 1]</code>.</p>

<p><code>&amp;</code> when using data, <code>a&amp;b</code>, creates an array of <code>a</code> copies of <code>b</code>. So, <code>_&amp;_</code> creates <code>_</code> copies of <code>_</code>. <code>4&amp;4</code> is, for example, <code>[4, 4, 4, 4]</code>. Then, <code>Sum</code> is called on that array. Thus, this squares a number.</p>

<div id="pu42" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bitwise_Cyclic_Tag" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Bitwise Cyclic Tag</a></h1>

<h3>Factoid:</h3>

<p>Bitwise Cyclic Tag is a programming language with only two commands, <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. It operates on an unbounded tape of bits and is <em>somehow</em> Turing-complete...? I don't yet understand this, but I'll be learning the language along with all of you. Bitwise Cyclic Tag is incredibly simple, even compared to brainfuck and other Turing tarpits, making it a very useful tool for proving other languages' Turing-completeness—if it can interpret BCT, it can do <em>anything</em>! In fact, our very own <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/66041/%C3%98rjan-johansen">Ørjan Johansen</a> did just this to prove <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki////" rel="nofollow noreferrer">///</a> Turing-complete in 2009, writing <a href="http://oerjan.nvg.org/esoteric/slashes/bct.sss" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this interpreter</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>0
</code></pre>

<p>This here is half of the language. When a zero bit is encountered in the code, the first bit of the data tape is discarded (some implementations print it as well). That's it. </p>

<p>This program demonstrates an important feature of BCT: the code is not run just once, but over and over until the data tape is empty (hence, "cyclic"), at which point execution halts. Therefore, this 0.125-byte program can be considered a sort of cat program, as in any implementation that prints on discard, this will print the entire starting data tape in order and exit gracefully. </p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>This here is the other command in BCT. It's a touch more complicated. When a one bit is encountered in the code, if the first data bit is a one, the following bit in the code is appended to the data (on the end). If the first data bit is a zero, nothing happens. In either case, the bit in the code immediately following the <code>1</code> is skipped. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that I was not completely honest about repeated execution in the first snippet. The code is treated as a loop (think Haskell's <code>repeat</code>), so if this snippet is executed, the bit possibly written is the <code>1</code> itself. This snippet, then, will infinitely add ones to the end of the data if the tape starts with a <code>1</code> or do nothing forever otherwise. </p>
</div>
<div id="pu43" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/tomtheisen/stax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stax</a></h1>

<p>Stax is a stack-based golf-oriented language.  That's a pretty crowded space, but stax has a few novel properties.  There's an <a href="https://staxlang.xyz/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter</a>.</p>

<h2>Two stacks</h2>

<p>There are two data stacks, "main" and "input".  The language name is inspired by this.  Normally standard input starts on the input stack, split into lines.  Most operations operate on the main stack.  However, if the main stack is empty, read operations fall back to the input stack instead.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<p>Falsy values are numeric zeroes and empty arrays.  All other values are truthy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Integer</strong> Aribitrary size</li>
<li><strong>Float</strong> Standard double precision</li>
<li><strong>Rational</strong> Fractions of integers</li>
<li><strong>Block</strong> Reference to unexecuted code for map/filter/etc</li>
<li><strong>Array</strong> Heterogeneous lists of any values</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compressed string literals</h2>

<p>Stax has a variant of string literals suitable for compressing English-like text with no special characters.  It is compressed using Huffman codes.  It uses a different set of Huffman codes for every pair of preceding characters.  The character weights were derived from a large corpus of English-like text.  <code>"Hello, World!"</code> could be written as  <code>`jaH1"jS3!`</code>.  The language comes with a compression utility.</p>

<h2>Crammed integer arrays</h2>

<p>Similarly to compressed string literals, stax also has a special feature for efficiently representing arrays of arbitrary integers.  It uses almost all the printable ascii characters.  It uses the information in each character efficiently to embed how long each integer is, and their values.  This feature is new in Stax 1.0.6.</p>

<h2>Debugger</h2>

<p>Stax has a web-based development and execution environment.  It runs entirely client-side with no ajax calls.  It features a step-through debugger that shows the current state, including all registers, stacks, and current instruction.  <code>|`</code> is a programmatic break instruction.  There is also a C# GUI and CLI for Stax.</p>

<h2>PackedStax</h2>

<p>PackedStax is an alternative representation for Stax code.  It is never ambiguous with Stax, since PackedStax always has the leading bit of the first byte set.  That means the same interpreter can be used for both representations with no extra information.  For ease of clipboard use, PackedStax can be represented using a modified CP437 character encoding.  It yields ~18% savings over ASCII.</p>

<h2>Rationals</h2>

<p>Stax supports fraction arithmetic.  You can use <code>u</code> to turn an integer upside down. So <code>3u</code> yields <code>1/3</code>.  Fractions are always in reduced terms.  <code>3u 6*</code> multiplies 1/3 by 6, but the result will be <code>2/1</code>.</p>

<h2>Implicit input eval</h2>

<p>Normally the text in the input starts in the input stack.  The stax runtime can parse input into stax data structures.  This is rather convenient for many PPCG posts, where input formats are flexible.  This happens only when certain conditions are met.</p>

<ul>
<li>Input contains no newlines</li>
<li>Parsing input succeeded.  Support types are integers, floats, rationals, strings, and arrays.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, this input would be parsed into corresponding values on the input stack.</p>

<pre><code>1 2.3 [4/5, "foo"]
</code></pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h2>Snippet: Length 0</h2>

<p>An empty program in stax will reduce a fraction.  This is the result of automatically evaluated input, and a built-in rational type.  Rational values are always in reduced terms.  And since there's no explicit output in the program, the top of the stack is implicitly printed.</p>

<h3>Snippet: Length 1</h3>

<p>A one character stax program can filter out the blank lines from standard input.  <code>f</code> is generally used to use a block to filter an array, but when it's the first character of a program, it uses the remainder of the program to filter the input lines.  The rest of the program is blank, so the filter is an identity filter, and blank lines are falsey.</p>

<h3>Snippet: Length 4</h3>

<p>In 4 bytes, you can use a block to map each character to its ascii code in hexadecimal.  There aren't strings per se in stax, but arrays of character codepoints are treated as strings in many contexts.  <code>{...m</code> establishes a block and maps every element in an array using the contents.  <code>|H</code> converts a number to hexadecimal.</p>

<p><code>.</code> is the leading character for a two-character literal and <code>..S</code> is the string literal <code>".S"</code>. <code>S</code> builds the powerset of the array, excluding the empty set, <em>i.e.</em> <code>[".",".S","S"]</code>. The result is then implicitly flattened and output.</p>

<div id="pu44" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Lambda Calculus</a></h1>
<h3>Factoid:</h3>
<p>The lambda calculus (specifically, the untyped lambda calculus) is, according to Wikipedia, &quot;a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.&quot; It was published by mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Alonzo Church</a>, of whom Alan Turing was a student, in 1936, and is equivalent to a Turing machine—that is, any problem solvable with an algorithm can be solved with this system.</p>
<p>The lambda calculus consists entirely of functions of one parameter. In its pure form, these functions are unnamed, but for ease of understanding, they are often given names like <code>plus</code> and <code>equals</code>. Most<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" rel="nofollow noreferrer">citation needed</a>]</sup> modern languages, including <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-operator#lambda-operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C#</a>, and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java</a>, support these anonymous functions.</p>
<h3>Length 1:</h3>
<pre><code>x
</code></pre>
<p>The variable x. A variable is the simplest example of a <em>lambda term</em>, or a valid lambda expression. Note that a variable need not have a type (in fact, <strong>must</strong> not in the untyped lambda calculus, as types do not exist [hence, untyped]).</p>
<h3>Length 3:</h3>
<pre><code>f x
</code></pre>
<p>Application of the function <code>f</code> to the variable <code>x</code>. Note that function application is left-associative, though this can be overridden with use of parentheses.</p>
<h3>Length 4:</h3>
<pre><code>λx.x
</code></pre>
<p>The identity function! This gives a first look at the form of functions. A lambda function consists of two parts: the parameter (the variable between the first <code>λ</code> [lowercase Greek letter lambda] and the first <code>.</code>), and the return value (everything after the first <code>.</code>). In this example, the parameter, <code>x</code>, is mapped to (guess) <code>x</code>, so the identity function returns whatever value it is fed, be it a number, a Boolean, or a lambda term.</p>
<p>This is an example of an inductive rule of lambda terms: if <code>t</code> is a lambda term and <code>x</code> is a variable, then <code>λx.t</code> is a lambda term. In this example, <code>t</code> is the lambda term <code>x</code>, so this rule makes <code>λx.x</code> a lambda term.</p>
<h3>Length 4:</h3>
<pre><code>λx.y
</code></pre>
<p>A slightly less interesting example, this is a function of <code>x</code> that returns <code>y</code> regardless of <code>x</code>'s value. Feed it <code>5</code>? It gives <code>y</code>. Feed it <code>λx.y</code>? It gives <code>y</code>. Since y is a variable and therefore a lambda term, this expression is indeed a lambda term.</p>
<h3>Length 5:</h3>
<pre><code>f x y
</code></pre>
<p>This is application of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying" rel="nofollow noreferrer">curried function</a>, the basis of the computational completeness of the lambda calculus. <code>f</code> is here called on <code>x</code>, returning <code>f(x)</code>, a function (this is called partial application—though <code>f</code> takes two parameters, one can create a new function by passing <code>f</code> only one). This new function is then applied to <code>y</code>. Because of the left-associativity of the lambda calculus, this is read as <code>(f(x))(y)</code> instead of <code>f(x(y))</code>.</p>
<p>An example of a use for this form: <code>f</code> maps <code>x</code> to a function that maps <code>y</code> to <code>x+y</code>. This is a change through currying of the basic addition function; instead of writing <code>plus(x, y)</code>, we write <code>plus(x)(y)</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 7:</h3>
<pre><code>λx.λy.x
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, something interesting! This function of x returns not a value, but another function! The return value is <code>λy.x</code> (which is effectively identical to <code>λx.y</code> above), so this expression takes an argument <code>x</code> and returns the constant-value function that returns the given <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>This function has some interesting behavior in conjunction with certain others, very similar to that of the Boolean true.</p>
<h3>Length 7:</h3>
<pre><code>λx.λy.y
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the previous example, but it returns the identity function rather than a constant-value one. As you will see soon, this can be made to behave like Boolean false.</p>
<p>This and the previous example are known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_Booleans" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Church booleans</a>.</p>
<h3>Length 7:</h3>
<pre><code>λf.λx.x
</code></pre>
<p>This very closely resembles the Church false; in fact, it is identical, despite the f and x in place of x and y! Through a process called α-conversion, the lambda term <code>λx.R</code> can become the equivalent expression <code>λy.R'</code>, where <code>R'</code> is <code>R</code> with all instances of <code>x</code> replaced with <code>y</code>. This is intuitive enough—if <code>f(x)=2x</code> and <code>g(y)=2y</code>, then <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are equivalent.</p>
<p>The different notation for this function and the Church false is to aid intuition. While the latter takes any two arguments and returns the second, this one is intended to take a function of a value (<code>f</code>) and a value (<code>x</code>). It then applies <code>f</code> to <code>x</code> <strong>zero times</strong> and returns the result.</p>
<p>With certain other convenient functions, this one can be treated as the number zero. This is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_numerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Church numeral</a>.</p>
<h3>Length 8:</h3>
<pre><code>(λx.x) y
</code></pre>
<p>Application of a function again, but this one actually does something, instead of merely serving as a template! The function <code>λx.x</code> is applied to the variable <code>y</code>, done by substituting <code>y</code> for <code>x</code> (the parameter) in the return value, <code>x</code>. This yields <code>y</code>, as one might expect from applying the identity function to <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>This process of replacing each instance of the parameter in the return value with the argument is called β-reduction.</p>
<h3>Length 9:</h3>
<pre><code>λf.λx.f x
</code></pre>
<p>Ooh, something exciting! This looks like the Church numeral for zero, but with <code>f x</code> in place of <code>x</code>. Here, the function <code>f</code> is applied <strong>once</strong> to <code>x</code>, and this result is returned. We'll call this the Church numeral for one. Noticing a pattern? Yep, the Church numeral for <code>n</code> returns a function of <code>x</code> that returns <code>f</code> applied to <code>x</code> <code>n</code> times.</p>
<h3>Length 14:</h3>
<pre><code>λa.λb.λf.f a b
</code></pre>
<p>This function pairs two values, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, creating a function that takes a function parameter <code>f</code> and returns <code>f</code> applied to <code>a</code>, applied to <code>b</code>. These pairs, known as Church pairs, will become very useful later on.</p>
<p>Of course, pairs would be useless without a way of retrieving their elements:</p>
<h3>Length 12:</h3>
<pre><code>λp.p λx.λy.x
</code></pre>
<p>This takes as input a Church pair and returns the first of the pair. Suppose <code>p</code> is the pair <code>(a, b)</code>. By the definition of pairs, <code>p</code> applied to <code>λx.λy.x</code> (Church true) is equivalent to <code>λx.λy.x</code> applied to <code>a</code>, applied to <code>b</code>. This returns <code>a</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 12:</h3>
<pre><code>λp.p λx.λy.y
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, this function returns the second element of a pair. Confirmation of this is left as an exercise for the reader (hint: it's the same as that for the previous snippet).</p>
<h3>Length 18:</h3>
<pre><code>λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)
</code></pre>
<p>Y'know what? Rather than adding a separate snippet for each natural number, why don't we include a recursive way of defining them? This is the successor function, one which takes as input a Church numeral and returns the next.</p>
<p>Here's an example: let's call this function on 1's Church numeral, <code>λf.λx.f x</code>. This gives us <code>(λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)) (λf.λx.f x)</code>, which is by α-conversion equivalent to <code>(λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)) (λg.λy.g y)</code> (this is done to avoid name collisions). β-reduction turns this into <code>λf.λx.f ((λg.λy.g y) f x)</code>.</p>
<p>Apply β-reduction once more, inside the parentheses, and we have <code>λf.λx.f ((λy.f y) x)</code>. Again! <code>λf.λx.f (f x)</code>... Ooh! This looks like what I would expect two's Church numeral to be! How nice.</p>
<p>Another look at the successor function reveals that it is quite intuitive: it takes a Church numeral <code>n</code> and returns another Church numeral, one that returns a function <code>f</code> applied to <code>n</code> applications of <code>f</code> to <code>x</code>—that is, <code>n+1</code> applications of <code>f</code> to <code>x</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 30</h3>
<pre><code>λa.λb.a (λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)) b
</code></pre>
<p>Spamming successor functions gets tedious. Let's skip all that and define addition! This snippet takes two Church numerals <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and returns their sum, as a Church numeral.</p>
<p>Of course, we must test this. Note that the outer parentheses contain the successor function exactly; since we already understand that one, let's just call it <code>SUCC</code> now. Our expression becomes <code>λa.λb.a SUCC b</code>.</p>
<p>Let's add two and three (defining <code>TWO</code> as <code>λf.λx.f (f x)</code> and <code>THREE</code> as <code>SUCC TWO</code>). <code>(λa.λb.a SUCC b) TWO THREE</code> is β-reduced to <code>(λb.TWO SUCC b) THREE</code> and again to <code>TWO SUCC THREE</code>. This does PRECISELY what we'd hoped—it applies succession to three two times, yielding two plus three!</p>

<p>Commands can be mixed and matched in any order you want. This program, for instance, takes a break and greats the world between two passes through the already mentioned song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."</p>

<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>HQ9+
</code></pre>

<p>Yup, The name of the language is actually a syntactically valid program by itself. One thing to notice here is how <code>Q</code> behaves when there are other characters in the program as well. In between hello world and 99 bottles of beer, it prints "HQ9+". While not a quine, the source code is at least part of the output.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>+++++
</code></pre>

<p>There are no other operations than <code>+</code> that can be applied to the accumulator. Thus, if we want to increase it by five, this is the shortest way to do it. While backwards compatible with HQ9+, the popular object-oriented extension of the language by David Morgan-Mar, HQ9++, is also going to create two new subclasses of the generic superclass if this code is executed. The output is the same though.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>QH99QH
</code></pre>

<p>We have seen that HQ9+ is capable of only a limited number of outputs, however, it can still output any <em>information</em>. Using the highest density of information per command (e.g. avoid to increase the accumulator), the flow rate of information is log2(3) bits per command. For many languages, this is not known exactly, but for English text it is assumed to be <a href="http://for%20English%20text" rel="nofollow noreferrer">around 1.3 bits per character</a>, a little less than HQ9+. I have here as an example chosen a tertiary encoding, where the output of the <code>H</code> command here represents a <code>0</code>, <code>Q</code> represents <code>1</code> and <code>9</code> represents <code>2</code>. Using that, the output of the program can be interpreted as "SE" for Stack Exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>QQQQQQQ
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly many get this one wrong, they think <code>Q</code> prints just a Q. But Each <code>Q</code> actually prints the whole source code of the program, here resulting in </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ<br>
  (49 of them)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a great tool for demonstrating quadratic growth, and make it possible for HQ9+ to be used in surprising ways, like in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/59497/53025">this answer</a> printing twice the length of the program to STDOUT.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>

<pre><code>+++Q++++
</code></pre>

<p>As the <code>+</code> command is effectively a NOP regarding output, a single <code>Q</code> placed anywhere in a string of <code>+</code> can be used to produce a quine of arbitrary length.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>BURLESQUE
</code></pre>

<p>Is this a quine or not? That depends on the interpreter used. It is not very clear in the specification if invalid characters should be ignored or not. In the interpreters that do ignore such characters, this is proper quine. Others just throw an error. That is not necessarily more correct either, as error management is not accurately specified either. (Ehm.. It is not mentioned...)</p>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre><code>H+H+H+H+H+
</code></pre>

<p>Many people will probably have some concerns about to language because of the very permissive specification potentially leading to spaghetti code or bad programming practises. This example is an attempt to disprove this myth by adapting principles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">structured programming</a>, by carefully incrementing the accumulator after each successfully executed statement. Each and every instruction is thus properly clarified.</p>

<p><strong>Length 12</strong></p>

<pre><code>219661 beers
</code></pre>

<p>Is it still possible to find interesting long programs in HQ9+? Well, we can take a look at iterating programs. If the above snippet is run through an interpreter ignoring non-existing commands, the <code>9</code> triggers our familiar song. The output, if you analyse it, contains exactly 60 <code>9</code>'s. Suppose we feed that back as an input, we end up with 60 new runs of the song. The number grows exponentially, so after three iterations, we have reached a total of 219661. Also worth mentioning is the growth of "Hello, world!". Each run of the song spawns 101 new ones (2 per verse, one extra in "t<strong>H</strong>e store"), and each one produces one child in the next iterations. That should give us 369761 in total on the third iteration.</p>

<div id="pu48" class="pu"><h1>Common Lisp</h1>
<p>Lisp (from LISt Processing) is one of the oldest languages still in use today (only FORTRAN is older). It is notable for being the first language where code is data and data is code; called homoiconicity. It was also the first language to have garbage collection. Originally designed by John McCarthy in a 1958 paper as an entirely theoretical language, it became a real language when Steve Russel realized that the eval function could be implemented on a computer. It's most prevalent in Artificial Intelligence, and is instantly recognizable from its preponderance of parentheses. Common Lisp was designed to unify many of the older Lisp dialects into a more standardized form.</p>
<p>I'll be trying for every snippet to be runnable on it's own, though not necessarily do anything of value. Additionally, because I'm using Common Lisp, the fundamental concepts and a lot of the syntax apply in other dialects, but certain functions won't work in, say, Scheme.</p>
<h3>Length 1</h3>
<pre><code>*
</code></pre>
<p>Because of the emphasis on the use of S-Expressions and lists for coding, there're very few valid expressions in Lisp that don't contain parentheses, called atoms. Anything typed directly into the REPL (read-eval-print loop) is treated as a variable and evaluated as such. <code>*</code> holds the previous value that was printed by the REPL.</p>
<h3>Length 2</h3>
<pre><code>()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the empty list, one of the most important symbols in Lisp. Every proper list in Lisp is terminated with an empty list, similar to how every proper string in C ends with <code>\0</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>
<pre><code>(*)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a basic function call, which consists of a symbol wrapped in parentheses. Lisp doesn't contain operators, they're just functions too. I picked multiplication specifically because it's not actually a binary function; the multiplication operator in Lisp takes an indefinite number of arguments. If it is given no arguments it returns <code>1</code>, the identity operator for multiplication.</p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<pre><code>`(1)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a cons cell, which is just another way of saying it's a pair of elements. In Lisp, each list consists of cons cells connected to cons cells, where the first element (the <code>car</code>) is the value and the second element (the <code>cdr</code>) points to the next cons cell. This forms the basis of Lisp being based upon linked lists. This particular cons cell has <code>1</code> as the car and the empty list as its cdr.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<h3>Length 7</h3>
<pre><code>(not t)
</code></pre>
<p>I want to touch on truth values in Lisp. This would return <code>nil</code>. In Common Lisp, <code>t</code> is the symbol for true while <code>nil</code> and <code>()</code> represent false and are equal to each other, but note that this definition isn't standard for all Lisp dialects; Scheme, for example, distinguishes between <code>#f</code> for false and <code>'()</code> for the empty list.</p>
<h3>Length 9</h3>
<pre><code>(cdr ())
</code></pre>
<p>As I said before, the cdr is the tail element of a list, which you can get with the function <code>cdr</code>. Likewise, you can get the head element, the car, with the function <code>car</code>. Pretty simple, right? The car and cdr of the empty list are both <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 10</h3>
<pre><code>(cons 1 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, enough length to start working with lists. <code>cons</code> creates a cons cell with the first parameter as the car and the second as the cdr. But instead of printing out <code>(1 2)</code>, it gives <code>(1 . 2)</code>. Going back to the length 2 snippet, a proper list is supposed to end with the empty list, so the cdr of the last cons cell should point to the empty list. In this case, the last cons cell points to <code>2</code>, so Lisp informs us that we have an improper list, but still allows us to do it, like how you can make a C-string without a <code>\0</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 11</h3>
<pre><code>(cons 1 ())
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have created our first properly formed list. It's a single cons cell with a car of <code>1</code> and a cdr of <code>()</code>. You'll notice that for every other list, I lead it with a backquote/tick; any other proper list would attempt to evaluate its first argument as a function with the remaining elements as parameters. Strictly speaking, <code>()</code> isn't a list though; it's a symbol composed of a <code>(</code> and a <code>)</code> that represents the empty list. Lisp allows you to use almost any printable character in a symbol name and will let you redefine any symbol as you want to.</p>
<h3>Length 12</h3>
<pre><code>(cdr `(1 2))
</code></pre>
<p>This would output <code>(2)</code>, not <code>2</code> as some people would guess. Remember, each cdr is supposed to point to either another cons cell or the empty list; obviously <code>2</code> isn't the empty list, so it must be another cons cell the a car of <code>2</code> and a cdr of <code>()</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 13</h3>
<pre><code>'#1=(1 . #1#)
</code></pre>
<p>This would produce a circular list with just the single value 1. If printed, it would print “(1 1 1 1 ...” forever, so that in practice it can be considered an infinite list (on which you can do <code>cdr</code> infinite times to obtain always the same result, itself!). Unless one assigns <code>T</code> to the global variable <code>*print-circle*</code>, in which case it will be printed as <code>#1=(1 . #1#)</code>.</p>

<div id="pu49" class="pu"><h1>The Infamous <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Shakespeare" rel="noreferrer">Shakespeare Programming Language</a></h1>
<p>Shakespeare Programming Language was created in 2001 by two Swedish students, Karl Hasselström and Jon Åslund, and it combines, as the <a href="http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/#SECTION00030000000000000000" rel="noreferrer">authors proclaim</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the expressiveness of BASIC with the user-friendliness of assembly language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answers go from top to bottom. Also, it's common to see me refer to older or previous snippets.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/posts/44766/edit">link for myself: edit</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Factoid:</strong></p>
<p>Shakespeare's code resembles, as one would expect, a Shakespeare play, where the variables are characters on the play and their value changes as they are &quot;insulted&quot; or praised&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>I
</code></pre>
<p>Shakespeare's code is divided in Acts, and the acts are themselves divided in Scenes, for &quot;jump-to&quot; causalities. Defining an Act as <code>Act I</code> means that it will be the first piece of the code to be run, per example - but not only.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>as
</code></pre>
<p>Used in a comparative between two &quot;characters&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>day
</code></pre>
<p>By now, you may be getting the feeling that SPL is very verbose. And weird. And you've seen nothing yet. <code>day</code>, in SPL, is 1. All &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; nouns are considered as <code>1</code>, as well as all &quot;negative&quot; ones are <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>rich
</code></pre>
<p>What is <code>rich</code>? An adjective. In SPL, adjectives make the value of the noun they're attached to multiply by two. See implementation on snippet 14.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Act I
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation of the first snippet. All acts may be given a title, such as <code>Act I: Hamlet must die!</code>, since everything after the Roman numeral is ignored by the parser.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>better
</code></pre>
<p>Every language has conditions, and SPL is no exception. Except, since this is a language with a lengthy syntax (and did I mentioned it to be weird?), its conditional statements are going to be long. Having Ophelia ask Juliet <code>Am I better than you?</code> is like having <code>if (Ophelia &gt; Juliet)</code> on most &quot;normal&quot; languages. And, of course, you can ask the other way around: <code>Am I not better than you?</code> is the equivalent of <code>if (Ophelia &lt; Juliet)</code>. And you can already guess how the <code>=</code> is translated to SPL: <code>as good as</code> - usage of code snippet 2.</p>
<p>However, <code>good/better</code> is not the only way to make comparisons in this shakesperian language, you can use any adjective. The same principle of snippet 3 applies here as well, with &quot;positive&quot; adjectives having the value <code>&gt;</code>, while &quot;negative&quot; ones mean <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Juliet:
</code></pre>
<p>This is the invocation of a variable; after this, his/her instructions/declarations/whatever will follow.</p>
<p>A limitation of SPL is that it has a limited number of variables: Romeo, Juliet, Hamlet, Ophelia, MacBeth and so on are a few examples of &quot;characters&quot; that will appear on a Shakesperian program.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Exeunt]
</code></pre>
<p><code>[Exeunt]</code> is placed when all &quot;characters&quot; leave the &quot;stage&quot;. Hopefully I can elaborate a bit more later on about the interaction between characters. Generally is the last instruction of any SPL program, although <code>[Exeunt]</code> isn't specifically the terminal &quot;character&quot; of the language. For another example, see snippet 27.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>as bad as
</code></pre>
<p>Nine characters just to represent a mere <code>=</code> - using snippet 2. Have I mentioned that SPL is weird? See snippet 30 for examples.
(and yes, there's more than one way to output it)</p>
<p><strong>Length 10 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>difference
</code></pre>
<p>A fancy way of representing <code>-</code>, a subtraction. You can have math operations on SPL, even though you'll probably need a full day to get it right.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong>
<em>(since I managed somehow to reach ten snippets of code, let's take a bit of a break and have another factoid about SPL)</em></p>
<p>If you want to run your shakesperian code in all its glory, there's <a href="https://shakespearelang.org/" rel="noreferrer">this site</a> - I'm still testing it, since I discovered it not even five minutes ago. There's also a way to translate it to C using <a href="http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/#SECTION00070000000000000000" rel="noreferrer">a translator</a>.</p>
<p>Another site for running SPL code is <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=SPL" rel="noreferrer">this one</a> that works by internally translating the SPL code to another esoteric language: Oracle PL/SQL.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Exit Romeo]
</code></pre>
<p>Yes! At last I can talk about the interaction between characters! In order to have its value changed or to interact with others, a &quot;character&quot; must be on stage - entering with <code>[Enter Romeo]</code>. If a character is addressed to but is not present, there's a runtime error and the program stops. Because, in SPL, the value of the variables is set by the amount of names they're praised with - or insulted with - by the other characters on stage. I feel that I should put an example to clear some confusion my lame explanation may create, but perhaps it's best to delay that a few snippets.</p>
<p><strong>Length 12 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Remember me.
</code></pre>
<p>SPL is pretty &quot;basic&quot;, alright - but it has stacks! When, per instance, Romeo tells Juliet to &quot;remember him&quot;, he's actually telling his loved one to push the Romeo's value into her stack. Popping the value is done with <code>Recall your happy childhood!</code>, or <code>Recall your love for me</code>, or basically any sentence that begins with <code>Recall</code> - the rest is just artistic drivel, like snippet 22.</p>
<p><strong>Length 13 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Let us return
</code></pre>
<p>The Shakesperian way of having a <code>goto</code>. And this is where the Acts and Scenes come in handy. If Romeo tells Juliet <code>we shall return to Act II</code> (yes, again, there are multiple ways of write it), the program will jump to that specific part of the code. It's also seen alongside conditional statements.</p>
<p><strong>Length 14 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>my little pony
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, it was a series back in the 80s. Here, it's <code>2*1</code>. Why? Because a <code>pony</code> is a (somewhat) positive noun and <code>little</code> is an adjective. So, remembering snippets 3 and 4, we have <code>little = &quot;2 *&quot;</code> and <code>pony = &quot;1&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Speak thy mind!
</code></pre>
<p>In a SPL program, you'll see this (or <code>Speak your mind!</code>, which is the same) <em>a lot</em>. This basically outputs the value of each &quot;character&quot; in digit, letter or anything else, depending on the character set being used by your computer. There's also <code>Open your mind.</code> that does almost the same thing, albeit only outputting in numeric form.</p>
<p><strong>Length 16 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>You are nothing!
</code></pre>
<p>When someone tells you this in real life, you'll feel depressed. When Ophelia tells this to Hamlet in Shakespearian programming, Hamlet feels worthless. What does this mean? That <code>Hamlet = 0</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Ophelia, a wench.
</code></pre>
<p>In a screenplay, before the actual play starts, the characters must be presented. In most programming languages, the variables must also be declared before use. Seeing that SPL is a programming language that resembles a screenplay, this is how you declare its variables, by stating which are the ones appearing during the program.</p>
<p>But what does &quot;a wench&quot; mean? Does it mean that it's a specific (and cool) data type name? Well... I hate to disappoint you, but it means nothing: everything after the comma is disregarded by the parser, meaning you can put there the most outrageous drivel you can think of.</p>
<p><strong>Length 18 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>lying sorry coward
</code></pre>
<p><code>-4</code> for all earthly creatures. Why? Because <code>2*2*(-1) = -4</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 19 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Romeo:
 Remember me.
</code></pre>
<p>At last!!! I can finally output a full correct syntax instruction (albeit a short one)! This is how you use snippet 12: firstly you declare who's talking, then on the next line you write the &quot;dialogue&quot;. Normally, only two &quot;characters&quot; are on stage, to avoid making the parser sad and confused. When you need another &quot;character&quot;, you take one from the stage and replace him by the new one.</p>
<p><strong>Length 20 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>cube of thy codpiece
</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to elaborate a bit more for this one, but, truth be told, the things I come up with are still too short for this snippet length. And, so, I bring you this, which ends up being <code>-1</code> - because (-1)<sup>3</sup> = -1 (and <code>codpiece</code> is a &quot;negative&quot; noun, since they're uncomfortable and all). SPL understands a few more elaborate arithmetic operations as <em>some</em> exponentiation and square roots.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong> <em>(yet another one, since we've reached another milestone)</em></p>
<p>The &quot;Hello World Program&quot; in Shakesperian has 89 lines and more than 2400 characters long, <a href="http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/#SECTION00091000000000000000" rel="noreferrer">as seen here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 21 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Listen to your heart.
</code></pre>
<p>In snippet 15 you outputted something; here, you input a number to the program. If you want to input a character, you'll use <code>Open your mind.</code> instead. And, needless to say, this value will be stored in the &quot;character&quot; being spoken to.</p>
<p><strong>Length 22 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Recall your childhood!
</code></pre>
<p>Popping an integer from a stack is done with this, as explained on snippet 12. When, per instance, Ophelia tells Hamlet the aforementioned sentence, it causes Hamlet to take an integer from his stack and assume that value.</p>
<p>Of course that, as long as the word <code>recall</code> is starting the sentence, you can fill in the rest with pretty much anything your creative shakesperian mind desires.</p>
<p><strong>Length 23 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Are you better than me?
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation of snippet 6. When a &quot;character&quot; makes a question like this to another, what he/she is doing is equivalent to <code>if (x &gt; y)</code> on more common programming languages. The follow-up of this instruction must be delayed until I have more characters available.</p>
<p><strong>Length 24 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Enter Romeo and Juliet]
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, &quot;characters&quot; may enter in pairs. It's not required to have one &quot;character&quot; entering the stage, being followed by another.</p>
<p><strong>Length 25 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>remainder of the quotient
</code></pre>
<p>25 characters just to write a <code>%</code>. 25 characters to have the remainder of a division. And to use it? Well, that's even bigger - see snippet 75.</p>
<p><strong>Length 26 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Let us return to scene II.
</code></pre>

<p>Declaring a Scene. As you can already expect if you've been coping with me, the important bit is the <code>Scene I</code>, the rest is artistic fluff.</p>
<p>There have been some compilers made (like <a href="https://github.com/drsam94/Spl" rel="noreferrer">this one that compiles from SPL to C, written in Python</a>) that instead refer to the text after the numbering of the Act/Scene.

<p>Yes, yet another constant (since we need <em>way more</em> characters to have arithmetic operations). This one is equal to <code>8</code>, because <code>2*2*2*1 = 8</code>.</p>

<p>The full instruction is more better looking that this, I'll give you that, but... here's our first arithmetic operation! What does it all mean, actually? Well, <code>pig</code> is a dirty animal (albeit tasty), so it's equivalent to <code>-1</code>, has two adjectives, meaning <code>fat lazy pig</code> equals <code>2*2*(-1) = -4</code>. But what about <code>yourself</code>? It's a reflexive pronoum, not a name nor an adjective. Well, remember that SPL is based on dialogues between &quot;characters&quot;; thus, <code>yourself</code> refers to the other &quot;character&quot; on stage. So, we arrive at the end and we discover that &quot;the sum of a fat lazy pig and yourself&quot; is, in fact, <code>-4 + x</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=assume" rel="nofollow noreferrer">assume</a> routine sets variable properties and makes it possible to set relationships between variables. A common use is shown in the example above: the assume routine declares that a variable 'x' is a positive real constant. Applying such an assumption makes it possible for Maple to simplify expressions such as:</p>

<pre><code>simplify( sqrt( x^2 ) )
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns 'x' only after an assumption is placed on the variable 'x'.</p>

<div id="pu53" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html" rel="noreferrer">Piet</a></h1>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>

<p>Piet is a programming language where the source code consists of images. Program flow starts with the top-left pixel and moves around the image between pixels and pixel groups until it terminates.</p>

<p>For legibility, Piet programs are commonly displayed in an enlarged version. In such a case the term <code>codel</code> is used to describe a group of same-coloured pixels that correspond to an individual pixel in the source image.</p>

<p>For this challenge, since Piet does not use characters, one codel per vote will be used for sample programs.</p>

<p><strong>1 Codel</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eB4XY.png" alt="1 Codel"></p>

<p>This is a valid program, it does nothing and terminates. The control flow starts in the top-left (only) pixel and has no way out, which ends the program.</p>

<p>The pixel can in this case be any colour for the exact same effect.</p>

<p><strong>2 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lRG1h.png" alt="2 Codels"></p>

<p>This will continually read characters from stdin and keep a running total of their unicode values (though nothing is done with this total and it is not displayed).</p>

<p>Progam flow moves back and forth between the 2 codels, since the only way out of each one is into the other. Commands in piet are executed by movement from one codel or region into another, depending on the difference in hue and lightness of the 2 regions. The <code>input</code> is the command moving left-to-right and then the <code>add</code> is right-to-left. On the first <code>add</code> command, nothing will happen since there is only one value on the stack, and the specification says that commands without enough values available are ignored.</p>

<p>This program is a loop that will never end, as most piet programs will be at extremely small sizes, since it takes at least a few codels to properly "trap" the program flow and end it.</p>

<p><strong>3 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFVzV.png" alt="3 Codels"></p>

<p>This is a basic echo-type program, it will read a character at a time from stdin and print it to stdout.</p>

<p>Again this is an infinite loop. The program starts by travelling left-to right, which does the <code>input</code> then <code>output</code>. The program will continue to flow in the same direction whenever it can. At the light green codel the only exit is to start moving back the other way. When travelling back right-to-left it attempts to perform <code>subtract</code> and <code>add</code> commands, but the stack is empty so these become no-ops.</p>

<p><strong>4 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m3XR2.png" alt="4 Codels"></p>

<p>Prints out 2 to stdout indefinitely.</p>

<p>Not a particularly interesting program functionally, but now that we finally have a composite number of codels we can show off slightly more advanced flow than left-to-right. When program flow attempts to exit a codel it first tries the current direction. If it's unable (in this case due to the edge of the image) it rotates 90 degrees clockwise and attempts to exit again. In this case, the program goes around clockwise 1 codel at a time, <code>push</code>ing 1 onto the stack twice, <code>add</code>ing the ones together, then <code>output</code>ing the result.</p>

<p><strong>5 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nYWRF.png" alt="5 Codels"></p>

<p>Repeatedly reads a character at a time from stdin and tracks the sum of their unicode values.</p>

<p>This is essentially the same functionality as the 2-codel version, but this challenge is about showcasing the language, and one of the cool things about piet is how you can have different-looking pictures that do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here we see the white codel for the first time, which allows program flow to slide across it without executing instructions. The magenta and blue codels do all the work here. Travelling from blue to red does nothing because it crosses the white codel in the middle. The 2 red ones just <code>push</code> the number 1 onto the stack and <code>pop</code> it back off as it travels left-to-right then right-to-left across them, and then across the white codel so no instruction is executed.</p>

<p><strong>6 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e8y5T.png" alt="6 Codels"></p>

<p>Again, repeating earlier functionality with a different look. This is another echo program that reads a character at a time from stdin to stdout.</p>

<p>Here we see our first black codel. Program flow cannot enter a black codel, so from the light magenta codel in the top-right the program will fail to exit right due to the image edge, fail to exit down due to the black codel, and bounce back left into the red codel. The blue and green codels are purely decorative, the program will never enter them.</p>

<p><strong>7 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EnEqR.png" alt="7 Codels"></p>

<p>Yet another echo program with a different look.</p>

<p>Here we see our first codel blocks larger than size 1. In piet, any contiguous block of codels of the same colour is treated as a single block. The size of the block does not matter except when executing the <code>push</code> instruction, so this program is treated exactly like the 3-codel version, except with different colours.</p>

<p><strong>8 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V9FYs.png" alt="8 Codels"></p>

<p>Reads a number from stdin and outputs the square to stdout, repeatedly.</p>

<p>Control flow is a basic clockwise pattern just as in the 4-codel program. Starting from the top-left, the operations in order are <code>input</code>, <code>duplicate</code> (pushes an extra copy of the top value of the stack onto the stack), <code>multiply</code>, <code>output</code>. Then it <code>push</code>es the value 1 onto the stack, slides across the white so no command is executed, and then <code>pop</code>s that 1 off of the stack when moving from the lower-left to upper-left codel. This returns it to the beginning of the program with an empty stack, and it repeats.</p>

<p><strong>9 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKnUm.png" alt="9 Codels"></p>

<p>Adds 1 + 2 = 3, and then terminates.</p>

<p>Now that we have a program with greater than 2 codels in both dimensions, we can finally set up a region that will trap the program and end it instead of looping forever. The first operation moving from the red codel to the dark red region is a <code>push</code> of 1, then the program rotates and flows down into the light red codel in the middle and <code>push</code>es a value of 2. Flowing from the light red to the light yellow executes an <code>add</code> operation. The bottom light yellow bar causes the program to end since there is no way for it to flow out as all the corners are blocked off.</p>

<hr>

<p>The 1- and 2-high programs are quickly becoming ugly and uninteresting so from this point on I'm going to focus on numbers that allow at least a few codels in each direction.</p>

<p><strong>12 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uGZR7.png" alt="12 Codels"></p>

<p>Finally a program that does something that could be argued as useful (though it's still a bit of a stretch). Reads 2 numbers from stdin sequentially and then outputs their sum, and does this repeatedly.</p>

<p>Program flows left-to-right across the 4 coloured bars perfoming 2 <code>inputs</code> followed by an <code>add</code> command. It then moves into the lower-right codel and performs an <code>output</code>, and then goes left across the white region back to the start.</p>

<p>This could have been done in 8 codels, but since we have the extra space we can make something that's a little bit inspired by an old no-signal TV display.</p>

<p><strong>15 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OjV6N.png" alt="15 Codels"></p>

<p>Reads a number from stdin and outputs its' square.</p>

<p>This uses a couple of tricks to get a bit of a symmetrical look to a program that actually does something. The leftmost red bar is a different colour on the bottom codel than the rest, taking advantage of the fact that (for me at least) these 2 shades of red look very similar. the program will move from the lighter red region right into the light blue codel, and then straight across the middle of the program to the light green on the right side where it is trapped. It performs <code>input</code>, <code>duplicate</code>, <code>multiply</code>, and <code>output</code> operations.</p>

<p>The darker red codel, along with the medium green codels on the top and bottom of the middle column, are decorative and the program will never reach them.</p>

<p><strong>20 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IiXez.png" alt="20 Codels"></p>

<p>Reads numbers from stdin until a 0 is read, at which point it outputs the sum of all entered numbers and exits.</p>

<p>We finally have enough room to do control flow in the form of the <code>pointer</code> operation. The 4 codels along the top perform <code>input</code>, <code>duplicate</code>, and <code>not</code> operations, and then another <code>not</code> operation moving from the magenta in the top-right to the 2-codel yellow below it. The <code>not</code> operation pops the top value off of the stack and pushes a 1 if the top value was a 0, and a 1 otherwise. Therefore a double-<code>not</code> replaces any nonzero value with a 1. Moving from the yellow bar down to the dark blue performs a <code>pointer</code> operation, which pops the top value off of the stack and moves the direction pointer clockwise that many times.</p>

<p>If the top value is a 1 (i.e. we didn't enter a zero) the direction pointer will point left, moving to the magenta codels for an <code>add</code> operation (which will be ignored the first time due to only one value on the stack) and then through the white back to the start of the program.</p>

<p>If the top value of the stack is a zero at the pointer operation, the direction pointer will not change and the program will continue downwards. Moving into the lighter blue band will <code>pop</code> the 0 that was entered off of the stack, leaving only the sum of the accumulated numbers. Moving into the cyan bar on the bottom will <code>output</code> that sum, and then end since the program flow is trapped.</p>

<p><strong>25 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BQKEu.png" alt="25 Codels"></p>

<p>Countdown! Reads a number from stdin, and then prints a countdown to 1 to stdout one number at a time. For example, if 5 is read, will print 54321.</p>

<p>The first operation from cyan to yellow is the <code>input</code>. Then the yellow is where the program "loop" starts. Yellow > Magenta > Blue is a <code>duplicate</code> then an <code>output</code>, so it prints the top value on the stack but keeps a copy. Moving down the right side, we <code>push</code> the value 1 onto the stack then perform a <code>subtraction</code>, decreasing our entered value by 1. Next is <code>duplicate</code>, <code>not</code>, and another <code>not</code> moving from the light magenta in the bottom-right to the dark yellow beside it. This is the same zero/nonzero check as the previous program. Moving left into the light blue codel performs a <code>pointer</code> operation, that will either move left into the dark cyan to end the program if we're done, or up to the yellow to re-start our loop without the initial input but the original value decreased by 1.</p>

<p>All 3 of the red codels are decorative and could be any colour.</p>

<p><strong>30 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE3q.png" alt="30 Codels"></p>

<p>Fibonacci generator. Prints out terms of the Fibonacci sequence to stdout and doesn't stop.</p>

<p>This is the first introduction of the <code>roll</code> operator, as well as the first time that a region size bigger than 1 is used with the <code>push</code> operator to get a specific value onto the stack.</p>

<p>As always starts in the top-left moving right. The first 2 operations <code>push</code> a 1 onto the stack and then <code>output</code> it since the Fibonacci sequence starts with two 1s, but the main program loop will only print 1 once. Then it <code>push</code>es 2 more 1s onto the stack to end up in the dark magenta in the top-right to start the main program loop.</p>

<p>Moving down the right side we <code>duplicate</code> and <code>output</code> to print off the next term of the sequence, then <code>duplicate</code> again to get a copy of the current sequence value. Moving left across the bottom executes 2 <code>push</code> operations. Since the light red region in the bottom-right is 3 codels in size, the first <code>push</code> will push a 3 onto the stack instead of a 1.</p>

<p>Moving up into the light blue is a <code>roll</code> operation. This pops the top 2 values off of the stack and performs a number of rolls equal to the first value popped, to a depth equal to the second value popped. In this case, it will perform 1 roll to a depth of 3. A roll to depth <code>n</code> takes the top value of the stack (our duplicated current value) and buries it <code>n</code> places deep. Our stack is only 3 deep right now so it will bury the top value at the bottom.</p>

<p>Moving up once more performs an <code>add</code> operation adding together the current sequence value with the previous sequence value. Our stack now has the next (new current) sequence value on top, and the last value below it. The program now moves right across the white into the dark magenta to start the loop again.</p>

<p>The yellow pattern in the middle is never used.</p>

<p><strong>54 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H7qdd.png" alt="54 Codels"></p>

<p>Prints "hi!" to stdout</p>

<p>Not a particularly long message, but printing in piet takes a surprising amount of room. Printing is done by using unicode values, and integers are pushed onto the stack by using the size of the region that is being exited. Since we have a very limited number of codels for this challenge, we use some math to get up to the printable range we want.</p>

<p>The program starts with a <code>push</code> of 5 from the cyan region on the left. From here, it flows right along the top with 6 <code>duplicate</code> operations to prime the stack with a bunch of 5s. Next is <code>push</code> 1, <code>subtract</code> to put a 4 on top of the stack, then 2 <code>multiply</code> operations to put 4*5*5=100 on top of the stack. Then a <code>duplicate</code> for 2 100s.</p>

<p>Now the program bounces off of the black and starts working leftwards along the bottom. <code>Push</code> operations of 3 and 2 and then a <code>roll</code> to bury the 2 100s under a 5. Next is <code>push</code> 1, subtract, and add to get 100+5-1=104 on top of the stack, which is unicode "h". Next 2 operations are <code>push</code> 1 and <code>pointer</code> to get around the corner and start moving right along the middle, and then <code>output</code> to print "h".</p>

<p>Next is <code>add</code> 100+5=105 on top of the stack, and <code>output</code> to print "i". The stack now contains two 5s. <code>Push</code> 1, <code>add</code>, <code>multiply</code> gives (1+5)*5=30. Finally <code>push</code> 3 and <code>add</code> for 33, and <code>output</code> for the trailing "!". The program then goes right through the remaining white space to end in the green on the right.</p>

<div id="pu54" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://bitbucket.org/zacharyjtaylor/my-language/src" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MY</a></h1>

<p>MY currently has no implemented codepage, so code will be listed in both bytes and the unimplemented codepage, one following the other. MY is stack based and "vector oriented" (like Jelly, some commands automatically "vecify" over their arguments). MY also has an "Object Subject Verb" visual order of commands.</p>

<h2>1 byte</h2>

<pre><code>27
↵
</code></pre>

<p>This program outputs <code>0</code> with a trailing newline. MY does not have implicit input nor implicit output, if one pops from an empty stack, it pops 0. </p>

<h2>2 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>1F 27
⍞↵
</code></pre>

<p>This program takes a line of raw input, then outputs it (with a trailing newline). MY can't do very much in 1 or 2 bytes due to lack of implicit IO.</p>

<h2>3 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>1F 64 27
⍞h↵
</code></pre>

<p>Reads a line from STDIN, then converts it from hexadecimal (must be uppercase) to an integer. This <strong>beats Jelly</strong>.</p>

<h2>4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>01 02 81 26
12-←
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the quirk of MY comes in, for multiple argument commands, MY pops the amount of arguments needed, then applies them to a function in the <strong>order that they are popped</strong>. OSV, this resembles (hence, the <code>Y</code> standing for <code>Yoda</code>). Thus, the above code outputs <code>1</code>  rather than <code>-1</code> (<em>without</em> a trailing newline).</p>

<h2>5 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>01 4D 02 80 26
1W2+←
</code></pre>

<p>This showcases MY's "vector orientation". This differs from APL and J, but is more like Jelly's concept of vectorizing ("vecifying" in MY). The program pushes 1 to the stack, wraps that in an array, pushes 2 to the stack, adds the top two elements, then displays with no newline (outputting <code>[3]</code> due to the "vecification" of commands).</p>

<p>Casio BASIC is very unlike TI-BASIC; firstly, it doesn't require as much RAM, memory or power. Programs typically only use a few KB of RAM. Secondly, it allows scrolling through the list of functions to write a program, or the use of special buttons which insert common characters. However, unlike TI-BASIC, functions can simply be typed in letter by letter from the keyboard.</p>

<div id="pu57" class="pu"><h2>TeX</h2>

<p>TeX was the first language to get its own StackExchange site.</p>

<p>(Note that we will show examples in plain TeX mostly; if any example is to be compiled using LaTeX, it will be clearly stated.)</p>

<h2>10 <code>cuff\/link</code></h2>

<p>TeX works well with  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ligatures</a> such as <code>ff</code>, <code>fl</code>, <code>ffl</code> or <code>fi</code> by default, i.e., it takes the correct ligature glyph from the font automatically. This is in general welcome of course, however, in some cases, it is frowned upon, such as in compound words. Compare the following two renderings of the word <em>cufflink</em>, the first one proper (ligature broken on the compound word boundary) and the second one improper (ligature crossing the compound word boundary). The first one is achieved by adding <code>\/</code> in the code in the correct place.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MC9e.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<h2>9 <code>\badness0</code></h2>

<p>Yes, in TeX, you can define how "bad" things are :-) Well, actually, badness inserted in a paragraph of text says how bad it is if a linebreak appeared at the specific place. Some things insert their own badnesses; for instance, it is worse to hyphenate words than not to, and the non-breaking space has badness of 10000, which is, in a sense, the infinite badness in TeX's eyes. Here, we set the badness to zero. We also see that assignments in plain TeX are done by concatenating the register (<code>\badness</code> here) and the value; optionally we can place the equals sign in between.</p>

<p>Actually, the concept of penalties (badnesses) is crucial for TeX; it's a typographic system and beauty is one of the goals, and Knuth designed TeX so that only deterministic algorithms are used to break paragraphs into lines and lines into pages, to ensure at least reasonable stability.</p>

<h2>8 <code>\def\x{}</code></h2>

<p>Simple definition. This defines a macro ("control sequence" in proper words) which does not take an argument and expands to ... well ... nothing :) (Do not be confused: "nothing" is not "relax", they substantially different.)</p>

<h2>7 <code>$$a+b$$</code> or <code>\[a+b\]</code></h2>

<p>Two snippets that <em>somehow</em> produce the same output, it's a displayed equation showing simple </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>a</em> + <em>b</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(just centred of course). The first is the correct thing to do in plain TeX. If only people knew how wrong it is in LaTeX, where the second one should be used!</p>

<h2>6 <code>\relax</code></h2>

<p>TeX is one of the languages that have its own "do nothing" action. However, <code>\relax</code> is more than just that, and this is related to the fact that it is an <em>expansion language</em>: All macros are expanded, and in some contexts, executed. The power of <code>\relax</code> is that it is executed to nothing, but it cannot be expanded, i.e., it survives any expansion unmodified. This in turn is one of the strenghts (and threats at the same time, especially for newcomers) of TeX.</p>

<h2>5 <code>X\bye</code></h2>

<p>A minimal document that compiles producing an output; we get a page with a 10-point "X" at the top and a centred page number "1" at the bottom. <em>... "X," said Tom, and added, leaving: "Bye!"</em></p>

<h2>4 <code>\bye</code></h2>

<p>When you say "bye" to TeX, it finishes the document; namely it closes the current paragraph if any is open, ships out the last page, and ends. Without this command, no document can be successfully produced.</p>

<h2>3 <code>$a$</code></h2>

<p>Prints the mathematical symbol "a", that can stand for instance for a variable, function or a constant. Without the dollars, it would be the text symbol "a"; it is necessary to distinguish these two!</p>

<h2>2 <code>&lt;endline&gt;&lt;endline&gt;</code></h2>

<p>Two consecutive ends of line finish a paragraph. (One end of line behaves like a space.)</p>

<h2>1 <code>%</code></h2>

<p>The percent sign starts a comment; the comment runs until the end of line, and eats the end of line together with leading whitespace on the next line.</p>

<li>Decimal was on <a href="//tio.run/#Decimal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tio.run</a> from day 1 of its release.</li>
<li>Decimal is not based on the top of the stack. It's based on a Default Stack Index (DSI). All functions that write to the stack set this index.</li>
<li>While very obfuscated, Decimal can be easily translated into pseudo-stack code.</li>
<li>All characters other than <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> and <code>D</code> are simply printed as they appear in the source code. This excludes whitespace.</li>

<p>
You might want to read from the bottom up. Sometimes I refer back to lower snippets, but never to higher ones, so it might help understanding.</p>

<p>Readers who do not know Haskell: am I clear? When am I not clear? I can't tell.</p>

<h1>Length 86 snippet</h1>

<p>A foldable instance for our tree data structure (snippet 23).
Foldable is a type class - as in, a class(/group) of types. These are parallel to interfaces in Java. They essentially generalize over types, unifying types which have common characteristics; for example, they can be added together (<code>Monoid</code>), containers (<code>Functor</code>), can be printed as text (<code>Show</code>, which we have met already, in the <code>show</code> function), and so on.
This one unifies data types which are list-like in that they can be iterated over or flattened to a list.</p>

<p>In this snippet, we define the instance by defining <code>foldr</code>, which essentially iterates over the data type from right to left. Now, we can use a bunch of general pre-written code. First, we define a helper function to get a singleton tree, to avoid all the clutter: <code>s a = N E a E</code>. Now:</p>

<pre><code>sum (N (s 3) 7 (N E 5 (s 8))     === 23
product (N (s 3) 7 (N E 5 (s 8)) === 840
toList (N (s 3) 7 (N E 5 (s 8))  === [3,7,5,8]
</code></pre>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of our tree:</p>

<pre><code>7
| \
3  5
    \
     8
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 70 snippet</h1>

<pre><code>primes=sieve[2..] where
 sieve(p:xs)=p:sieve(filter(\x-&gt;x`mod`p/=0)xs)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a prime sieve!</p>

<p>(note: <code>/=</code> is what <code>!=</code> is in other languages)</p>

<p>This works by defining a function <code>sieve</code> which filters the list and keeps only the numbers which are not divisible by any previous prime. It is defined recursively - to <code>sieve</code> is defined as to split the list to a first element <code>p</code> and a tail, filter from the tail any number divisible by <code>p</code>, <code>sieve</code> the remaining bit, attach <code>p</code> to the start of that, and return.</p>

<p>Again, we are working with infinite lists here - but the computation will halt in time as long as you don't require an infinite amount of primes to be computed.</p>

<pre><code>take 4 primes === [2,3,5,7]
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 68 snippet</h1>

<p>Finally, a quine!</p>

<pre><code>main=do putStr s;print s where s="main=do putStr s;print s where s="
</code></pre>

<p>In your first time reading this, you might think that the output of this quine would be missing the quotation marks, and why would you once write <code>putStr</code> and once <code>print</code>? It sounds the same.</p>

<p>In Haskell, <code>putStr</code> is a function that just prints the contents of the string it gets to stdout; <code>print</code>, though, prints things to stdout.
So, <code>print 4</code> is equivalent to <code>putStr "4\n"</code>, but <code>putStr 4</code> is nonsensical - <code>4</code> is not a string!
So, when <code>print</code> gets a value, it first converts it into a string, and then prints that string. Generally the way to convert things to strings is to find the way you would write it down in code. So, the way you would write the string <code>abc</code> in a string in Haskell code is <code>"abc"</code>, so <code>print "abc"</code> actually prints <code>"abc"</code>, not <code>abc</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 33 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>main=go 0
go n=do print n;go(n+1)

<p>The important thing to note is that we didn't use a loop. Haskell doesn't loop. Haskell recurses. Haskell doesn't have loops. It's deeper than that: <b>Haskell doesn't even have Control flow</b>.
How, you might ask? Well, it doesn't need any.</p>

<p>On with the details.
This program prints an infinite increasing sequence of integers, starting from 0.
<code>go</code> prints them starting with its input, then <code>main</code> calls it on <code>0</code>.</p>

<p><code>do</code> is a special syntactic power of Haskell. In this scenario, it just combines I/O actions, just like <code>&gt;&gt;</code> does (see snippet 22).</p>

<h1>Length 26 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>map f=foldr(\x y-&gt;f x:y)[]
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the <code>map</code> function, probably familiar to everyone, using <code>foldr</code>.
Notice that although we didn't declare <code>map</code>'s type, the computer somehow knows its type is <code>(a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]</code>, i.e. given a function from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>, and a list of <code>a</code>s, return a list of <code>b</code>s.</p>

<h1>Length 25 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>main=putStr"Hello World"
</code></pre>

<p>The standard Hello World. Note the types: <code>main</code> has type of <code>IO ()</code> and <code>putStr</code> has type of <code>String -&gt; IO ()</code> (a function from strings to I/O actions which return nothing).</p>

<h1>Length 23 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>data T a=E|N(T a)a(T a)

<p>This is a standard definition of a Tree. How much easier than all those lines required to define a tree in Java, C, or anything else.</p>

<p>(see snippet 10)</p>

<p>Let's break it down:</p>

<p><code>data</code> - this declaration declares a data type.
<code>T a</code> - a tree containing elements of type <code>a</code>. This is the type we are defining.
<code>=</code> - every value of <code>T a</code> will be any of the following, separated by a pipe <code>|</code>.
<code>E</code> - one of the possible values of <code>T s</code> - the empty tree.

<p>A better definition for <code>fix</code>. (See snippet 14.)
The problem with the first definition, <code>fix f = f(fix f)</code>, is that every time we call <code>fix f</code> <code>fix</code> recalls <code>fix f</code>, which recalls <code>fix f</code>, generating endless copies of the same computation. This version fixes it by defining <code>r</code> (result) to be the result; as such, <code>f r = r</code>. So, let's define <code>r = f r</code>. Now we return <code>r</code>.</p>

<p><code>(\x -&gt; x + x + x)</code> is a lambda (someone thought <code>\</code> resembles the letter.).</p>

<p><code>(\x -&gt; x + x + x) n</code> is the lambda applied to <code>n</code> (this is exactly the same as <code>n + n + n</code>).</p>

<p><code>f</code> is the multiply-by-three function (also <code>f = (*3)</code>)</p>

<h1>Length 15 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>sum=foldl (+) 0
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the <code>sum</code> function using a fold. A fold is basically a loop over the elements of a list with one accumulator.<br>
<code>foldl</code> takes as arguments some function <code>f</code> and some initial value <code>x</code> for the accumulator and a list <code>xs</code>. The function <code>f</code> should get as input the previous accumulator value and the current value of the list, and it returns the next accumulator.<br>
Then the fold iterates on the list values, applying <code>f</code> on the previous accumulator, and then returns the last accumulator.</p>

<p>Another way to think about folds is like the fold 'inserts' <code>f</code> between the list values and with the initial accumulator in one of the sides. For example, <code>foldl (*) 1 [4,2,5]</code> evaluates to <code>1 * 4 * 2 * 5</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 14 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>fix f=f(fix f)

<p>The <code>y</code> combinator. It is usually named <code>fix</code> because it finds the fixpoint of the equation <code>f x = x</code>. Note that <code>x = infinite loop</code> can also sometimes a solution, so <code>fix (\x -&gt; x^2 + 5*x + 7)</code> won't solve the equation <code>x^2 + 4*x + 7 = 0</code> but instead return an infinite loop.</p>

<p>You may also note that not always <code>x = infinite loop</code> is a solution, because of Haskell's laziness.</p>

<p>This version is a time and space leak; we will redefine it in a longer snippet.</p>

<h1>Length 13 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>f=sum.map(^2)
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the <b>function</b> <code>f</code> that given a list returns the sum of its squares. It is the <b>function</b> composition of the <b>function</b> <code>sum</code> and the <b>function</b><code>map(^2)</code>, which in turn is the <b>function</b> <code>map</code> applied to the <b>function</b> <code>(^2)</code> (the <i>square</i> <b>function</b>), which is in turn a section of the <b>function</b> <code>^</code> (sections were introduced at snippet 2, and composition at snippet 3).</p>

<p>As you can see, <b>functions</b> are quite important in a <b>functional</b> language like Haskell. In fact, it has been said that Haskell is the language with the most standard library <b>functions</b> which get <b>functions</b> as inputs or return <b>functions</b> as outputs (this is commonly known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function" rel="noreferrer">higher-order <b>function</b></a>.</p>

<pre><code>data B=T|F
</code></pre>

<p>This is a definition of Haskell booleans with different names. The boolean type is named <code>B</code>.<br> This definition introduces two constructors: true (<code>T</code>) and false (<code>F</code>).<br>
This code snippet basically tells the compiler that every boolean (<code>B</code>) is either true (<code>T</code>) or false (<code>F</code>), or in other words, <code>B=T|F</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, all data types ever can be defined in Haskell, when in other languages the number, references and array data types need special support from the compiler. In practice there is special support in Haskell as it would be very inconvenient otherwise, but for example the <code>Bool</code> datatype is defined entirely in language.</p>

<h1>Length 9 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>main=main
</code></pre>

<p>This nonsensical program will define <code>main</code> to be main. Because Haskell is lazy, values which would require an infinite loop to evaluate can be used freely if we don't use their actual value. Such values which contain infinite loops, like our <code>main</code>, are called "bottoms".</p>

<p>A fun fact is that the GHC Haskell compiler can detect these kinds of infinite loops and throw a catchable (!) exception when it is run.</p>

<h1>Length 8 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>f(x:_)=x
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the function <code>f</code> which, given a non-empty list, will return its head.</p>

<p>Patterns in Haskell are like Python's sequence unpacking, but generalized for all types. Patterns can either reject or match a value, and if it matches, can bind variables to values.</p>

<p>The patterns in this snippet are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>_</code>: the pattern which matches anything and binds no variable.</li>
<li><code>x</code>: the pattern which bind anything and binds it to the variable <code>x</code>.</li>
<li><code>:</code>: this pattern gets to child patterns, that is, one for the head, and one for the tail. If the list is non empty, it matches them with the head and the tail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pattern matching is highly generalized. In fact, just defining new data types will automatically introduce patterns for working with them.</p>

<h1>Length 5 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>x=2:x

<p>Whoa, there's so much to explain on this one.</p>

<p>First of all, Haskell is lazy. This means that subexpressions will be evaluated only when strictly necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this code snippet doesn't show assignment, but definition. Haskell doesn't have assignment.</p>

<p>This code snippet defined <code>x</code>, an infinite list made up entirely of <code>2</code>. Usually in other languages <code>x</code> has to be evaluated before <code>2:x</code> can ever be evaluated, but in Haskell we can do this.</p>

<p>Haskell infinite lists are sort of a mix of iterators and regular linked lists: they act like both (an iteration over a range will use constant memory, for example).</p>

<h1>Length 4 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>2:[]
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet just encodes the singleton list <code>[2]</code>.
<code>:</code> is the <em>Cons</em> operator in Haskell. In fact, the regular list syntax is just syntactic sugar for the cons operator and the empty list literal. This tightly ties in into the way Haskell deals with Pattern matching and Data types (particularly the concept of constructor).</p>

<p>When this code is wrapped in parentheses (for syntactical reasons) it is called a "section".

this is done too in JavaScript, Python and so forth, but unlike those, it is done with full type safety.</p>

<div id="pu61" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://codepen.io/programmer5000/pen/zwYrVd" rel="noreferrer">CGL (CGL Golfing Language)</a></h1>

<p><sub>(or Code Golf Language, this was not intentional :)</sub></p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>CGL uses the stack concept like a lot of other golfing languages, but unlike them it has an infinite number of stacks that it has. Most operators operate on the current stack except some that change the current stack or move things. Stacks have numerical indexes. 0 is the default stack. The <code>-1</code>th stack is where input is stored.</p>

<p>I am unsure how bytes are counted for some of this unicode, so feel free to correct me in comments.</p>

<h2>1 byte</h2>

<pre><code>h
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs <code>Hello, World!</code>. Actually pushes <code>Hello, World!</code> to the current stack (default <code>0</code>) and the first element in the current stack is outputted by default. </p>

<h2>2 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>-²
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of possible 2 byte programs, but I wanted to show a cool operator in this one: <code>-</code>. <code>-</code> decrements the current stack, in this case switching from <code>0</code> (default) to <code>-1</code> (where input is stored). <code>²</code> squares the current stack. The first item in the current stack is outputted by default, so this squares the input and returns it.</p>

<h2>3 bytes (uses a combining character)</h2>

<pre><code>'҄҄낄䀀
</code></pre>

<p>This shows off the neat string compressing function. Normally, you wrap a string in <code>"</code>s and it is pushed to the current stack. <code>'</code>s enable you to use compressed strings. <code>҄낄䀀</code> is the compressed version of <code>Hi!</code> (note in this example, there is no compression savings, but with longer strings there often is. Also, you can use <code>&amp;</code> to compress the current stack.) Quotes are auto-completed if you leave them off.</p>

<h2>4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>-#2➕
</code></pre>

<p>Adds 2 to the input. <code>➕</code> adds the second stack item to the first or <code>1</code> to the first if the second stack item is non-existent.</p>

<h2>5 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>-#1＋Ⓧ
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>#</code> pushes the following number to the stack. Note that technically numbers are <em>wrapped</em> in #s, but if you leave them off they will be added between the last digit and any non-number character. The <code>＋</code> (diffrent from <code>+</code>) adds the first 2 stack items and pushes that to the stack. <code>Ⓧ</code> outputs the last item from the stack and exits. This therefore adds 1 to the input.</p>

<div id="pu62" class="pu"><h1>C – <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/posts/44698/edit">edit</a></h1>

<p>Thanks for the votes! When compared to other languages and what they can do in limited bytes, C looks obsolete, fussy and too dependent on the developer. In many ways it is: scripted and higher level languages with automatic memory management are much more expressive and quicker to production than C will ever be.</p>
<p>So why feature C?</p>
<p>The hidden secret behind all those scripting languages is that the interpreters are likely written in C (or more recently, C++ or Java). The first C++ compilers actually compiled to C code. In fact, until there's a market for a direct compiler, it's usually more cost effective to write a compiler to generate C, and then compile that.</p>
<p>If you're working on very small platforms, maybe even without an operating system available, you're likely working in C. These days, just about every appliance has a microcontroller embedded in it, no doubt programmed in C. When they need it small and fast, C is the way to go. (Also FORTH, for the masochists.)</p>
<p>Knowing C takes you as close to the metal as you can go without getting into assembler, and helps you in other languages. You have a good idea how a C++ virtual function probably works. You know when you write those pass-by-value recursive functions in PHP, that internally it's doing a lot of memory allocation and copying, so you instinctively try out pass-by-reference. Callbacks and references don't freak out C developers, maybe Haskell does though.</p>
<p>As Kernighan and Ritchie mentioned in their preface of the classic <em>C Programming Language</em>, 2nd edition, <em>C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.</em> I'm trying to follow this advice: examples do double, triple or more duty if possible.</p>
<p>All the snippets are at least compilable on their own. Those that are linkable and executable are indicated as such. I know this isn't a requirement, but it makes it simpler than trying to explain the framework required to make any code snippet work.</p>
<p>I also tried to make sure each code snippet was as short as possible so that I'm not introducing extra spaces just to pad to a certain length. In cases where code is indented, the indents are not included in the length, just one character for each new line.</p>

<p>In particular, in K&amp;R C, the code above is assumed to be a global integer <code>x</code> initialized to 0. Compiling it in K&amp;R mode will produce an object file which provides any program linking to it this variable for its use.</p>

<p>C99 includes support for complex numbers. As you can see from the code, it takes the form of a modifier for a real type. You could also use <code>int complex c=3+I*4;</code> but internally it coerces to a floating point type. The above code will compile in gcc using <code>gcc -std=c99 -c length-48.c</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to see more of the internals, try compiling with the -E switch. For my version of gcc, the declaration above becomes <code>double _Complex c=3.0+(__extension__ 1.0iF)*4.0;</code>. Note that the complex type is a significant addition to the language, not just a few cheap macros.</p>
<p>This is just a teaser, when we get to more than 125 characters, then we can start having some real fun with complex numbers!</p>

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
main(){double d=sqrt(sin(3.2));}
</code></pre>
<p>For various reasons, C doesn't automatically link to the standard mathematical functions such as sin, cos, tan, sqrt, etc. So if they're used, but not linked, the developer will be presented with the linker error <strong>undefined reference to 'sqrt'</strong>, or some other error.</p>
<p>In gcc, the code above will compile and link using <code>gcc length-51.c -lm</code>.</p>
<p>Note <code>sin(3.2)</code> will return a negative number, of which the square root is not legal in the real domain. In C, a special value <code>NaN</code> is returned to indicate this error, which the program is free to ignore!</p>
<p>In C99, there are a lot of new exception handling functions to provide very safe and fine-grained control of these kinds of math errors, which just about nobody uses!</p>

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int w;static int X(int x){static int s=0;s^=x;return s;}
</code></pre>
<p>Or formatted more sanely:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int w;
static int X(int x)
{
    static int s=7;
    s^=x;
    return s;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you might have guessed, this is all about the keyword <code>static</code> which has more than one meaning in C.</p>
<p>In the first two cases, <code>static</code> is telling the compiler that integer <code>w</code> and function <code>X</code> are not visible outside of this file or compilation unit, i.e. they are internal.</p>
<p>These functions are not intended to be called externally, so they might not check the arguments for validity, and cut other corners. Because they have internal scope, you can redefine <code>w</code> and <code>X</code> in other files, and they will usually be separate.</p>
<p>In the last case, <code>static</code> indicates that the integer <code>s</code> retains its value between function calls. The first time <code>X</code> is called, <code>s</code> will be its initial value <code>7</code>, when it is exclusive-ORed with <code>x</code>, the new value will be retained.</p>
<p>Internally, although it is implementation dependent, the usual memory organization is that <code>s</code> is residing on the heap, specifically initialized memory, while the argument <code>x</code> is residing on the stack. Where variables reside is important if you want to implement recursive algorithms, for example.</p>
<p>A gotcha in C are clashes with global variables. Until <code>w</code> and <code>X</code> are actually defined as <code>static</code>, if they are defined globally somewhere, then <code>w</code> and <code>X</code> will refer to the global entities instead.</p>
<p>Here <code>q</code> and <code>w</code> may not be initialized to the same value, because a global <code>w</code> is being used to set <code>q</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int q = w;
static int w;
</code></pre>
<p>If a global <code>w</code> doesn't exist, the compilation should fail.</p>
<p>Here <code>q</code> and <code>w</code> will be initialized to the same value:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int w;
static int q = w;
</code></pre>
<p>Typically, designers will reduce name clashes by adding a distinctive prefix or suffix to their global variables and functions.</p>
<p>In C99, <code>static</code> has gained another use, e.g. <code>int Y(int a[static 10]);</code> which means that there is a function <code>Y</code> which takes an array of <em>at least</em> 10 integers.</p>
<p><strong>Length 74 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>void f(register int*p,register int*q,register int l){while(l--)*p++=*q++;}
</code></pre>
<p>Or laid out nicely:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>void f(register int *p, register int *q, register int l)
{
    while (l--)
        *p++ = *q++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code>register</code> provides a hint to the compiler that using hardware registers would be beneficial here. The above function will copy <code>l</code> integers from <code>q</code> to <code>p</code>, using hardware registers if possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes the speedups could be significant. For example, in the 68K microprocessor family, the line <code>*p++ = *q++</code> could be translated to a single instruction <code>MOVE.W (Ap)+,(Aq)+</code> vs. six or eight if you didn't use <code>register</code>. The 68K microprocessor had explicit post-increment and pre-decrement modes, so the savvy developer, if he knew the platform, would tailor code by using <code>x++</code> and <code>--y</code> vs. <code>++x</code> and <code>y--</code>.</p>
<p>These days compilers mostly ignore <code>register</code>, other than not allowing addresses to be taken of them (e.g. in the above <code>&amp;l</code> would cause a compiler error).</p>

int f(int x){return(x&gt;1)?x*f(x-1):1;}int main(){printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,f(12));}

<p>Or with a saner layout:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int f(int x)
{
    return (x &gt; 1)? x * f(x - 1): 1;
}

int main()
{
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, f(12));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, recursion! The snippet is a complete program to compile, link and run. The function <code>f</code> calculates the factorial of its argument <code>x</code> by using the recursive formula f(x) = x * f(x - 1). Factorials get big really quickly, so for example <code>f(12)</code> is the largest value you can get in a signed 32-bit integer.</p>
<p>For an example of <strong>really</strong> recursive code, look into naïve implementations of the <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ackermann_function#C" rel="noreferrer" title="Ackermann function">Ackermann function</a>.</p>
<p>Smart compilers can optimize the function, using the hint <code>inline</code> and &quot;unroll&quot; the function when constants are provided as arguments so that:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>f(12)
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
</code></pre>
<p>Without any function calls required!</p>
<p>Other compilers can reorganize the function:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>int f(int x)
{
    return (x &lt; 2)? 1: f(x - 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>And implement something called tail-recursion. This in effect replaces the last function call to a simple goto and lets that function deal with the return. The benefit is less stack thrashing, faster and smaller code.</p>
<p>In assembly language, these kinds of optimizing opportunities are really easy to spot and can be implemented by something called a &quot;keyhole optimizer&quot;, which basically looks for small patterns and replaces them with something faster and/or smaller.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>C borrowed from languages contemporary at the time, the concept of a universal I/O which could be consistently applied to any device, whether console, punch card, tape, disc or printer, but in true C form, it allowed the developer to create very terse but powerful statements.</p>
<p>In the above snippet, it will take command line input, parse two integers separated by spaces, tabs or commas and output them. It takes advantage of a newer <code>scanf</code> specifier <code>%*[\t ,]</code> which will: <code>[\t ,]</code> pull out all tabs, spaces and commas, and: <code>*</code> ignore them.</p>
<p>I remember revising some C++ code where the developer was doing everything the &quot;pure&quot; C++ way with <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and an arsenal of methods like <code>find</code> and <code>substr</code>. It was at least a dozen lines and it still couldn't handle commas as delimiters. I replaced all that clunky code with a single <code>sscanf</code> line like above!</p>

<h3>Snippet 26 - iterate over matrices</h3>
<p>This is something I just recently discovered. Usually you iterate over a given vector in for loops. But instead of vectors, you can also use matrices (<code>rand(10)</code> produces a 10x10 matrix with uniformly distributed numbers between 0 and 1).</p>
<pre><code>for k=rand(10);disp(k);end
</code></pre>
<p>This then displays one column vector of the random matrix per iteration.</p>
<h3>Snippet 25 - easy plotting</h3>
<p>We know plotting is easy in matlab, but there is a super easy function <code>ezplot</code> (<code>E-Z</code> get it? It took quite a while until I finally got it, as I spelled <code>Z</code> always as <code>sed</code> instead of <code>c</code>, whatever...) Everyone likes elliptic curves:</p>
<pre><code>ezplot('y^2-x^3+9*x-10.3')
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aj3x1.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aj3x1.png" alt="elliptic curve" /></a></p>
<h3>Snippet 24 - integration</h3>
<p>The old fashioned word (but still in use in numerical computation) for integration is 'quadrature', can you guess what the result of the following one is?</p>
<pre><code>quad(@(x)4./(1+x.^2),0,1)
</code></pre>
<h3>Snippet 23 - images</h3>
<p>Of course Matlab is also very popular among scientists who have to work with images (e.g. medical image analysis), so here is a very handy function. First argument is the image, second the angle and the third optional argument here tells the function to crop it to original size.</p>
<pre><code>imrotate(rand(99),9,'c')
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IkVJ9.png" alt="here" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 22 - music</h3>
<pre><code>load handel;sound(y,Fs)
</code></pre>
<p>It will sound about like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/wIIH5Bva738&amp;start=9&amp;end=19&amp;autoplay=1" rel="noreferrer">this (youtube link)</a></p>
<h3>Snippet 21 - differentiate &amp; integrate</h3>
<pre><code>polyint(polyder(p),c)
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily differentiate and integrate polynomials by using those two functions. When integrating, you can pass a second argument that will be the constant.</p>
<h3>Snippet 20 - back to polynomials</h3>
<pre><code>p=poly(r);cp=poly(A)
</code></pre>
<p>Want the polynomial with the roots in <code>r</code>? Easy: <code>p=poly(r)</code>. Want the characteristic polynomial of a matrix <code>A</code>? Easy: <code>cp=poly(A)</code>. So <code>roots(p)</code> is exactly <code>r</code> (or a permutation of <code>r</code>).</p>
<h3>Snippet 19 - another magic trick</h3>
<pre><code>fminsearch(fun,x0);
</code></pre>
<p>There are people who absolutely love this function. This basically just searches a minimum of <code>fun</code> with an initial value <code>x0</code> (can be a vector) without any conditions on <code>fun</code>. This is great for fitting small models where you cannot (or you are too lazy) to differentiate the error/penalty/objective function. It uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method" rel="noreferrer">Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm</a> which is pretty fast for functions where you cannot make any assumptions.</p>
<h3>Snippet 18 - intro to polynomials</h3>
<pre><code>p=polyfit(x,y,deg)
</code></pre>
<p>Matlab has a nice solution for coping with polynomials. With <code>polyfit</code> you get a least squares polynomial of degree <code>deg</code> that approximates the points in <code>x,y</code>. You get a vector <code>p</code> that stores the coefficients of the polynomials, because that is the only thing what you need for representing a polynomial. If you go back to snippet 15, you can do the same thing by writing <code>c = polyfit(x,y,2)</code>.  So e.g. <code>[1,-2,3]</code> represents the polynomial <code>x^2 - 2*x+3</code>.
Of course there are also functions for fitting other elementary, or arbitrary functions.</p>
<h3>Snippet 17 - angles and discontinuities</h3>
<pre><code>unwrap(angle(c))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to get the argument of a 'continuous' vector of complex numbers you often get back values that seem to have a discontinuity. E.g. <code>angle([-1-0.2i,-1-0.1i,-1,-1+0.1i,-1+0.2i])</code> will get you <code>[-2.94,-3.04,3.14,3.04,2.94]</code> since <code>angle</code> only returns angles between <code>-pi</code> and <code>pi</code>. The function <code>unwrap</code> will take care of this! If you get a discontinuity like this, it will just add a multiple of <code>2*pi</code> in order to remove those: '[-2.94,-3.04,-3.14,-3.24,-3.34]' This even works for 2d-matrices! If you just plot the argument of complex numbers with a negative real part you get the first graphics you'll get the first image, with unwrap you get the second one:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/avwYe.png" alt="without unwrap" /> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgqwJ.png" alt="with unwrap" /></p>
<pre><code>[x,y] = meshgrid(-1:0.01:0,-0.5:0.01:0.5);
z = x+i*y;
imagesc(angle(z))
imagesc(unwrap(angle(z)))
</code></pre>
<h3>Snippet 16 - scalar product</h3>
<pre><code>[1;2;3]'*[4;5;6]
</code></pre>
<p>Of course there are built in methods (like <code>dot</code>), but with the matrix-transformation operator <code>'</code> it is as simple as that. If you do not know whether you have row or column vectors, you can just use <code>a(:)'*b(:)</code> where <code>a(:)</code> always returns a column vector.</p>
<h3>Snippet 15 - linear least squares, the ugly method with the magic wand</h3>
<pre><code>[x.^2,x,x.^0]\y
</code></pre>
<p><code>x</code> is the (column) vector with the values on the x-axis, <code>y</code> the noisy y-values. Type <code>c=[x.^2,x,x.^0]\y</code> and you get the coefficients of the 2nd degree polynomial. Of course you can use one of the billion builtin fit functions of matlab (how boring) why not use the magic wand?=)</p>
<pre><code>x = (-1:0.1:2)';
y = 3*x.^2-2*x+1+randn(size(x)); %add some gaussian (normal) noise
A = [x.^2,x,x.^0];
c = A\y              %output: c = ]3.0049; -2.3484; 1.1852]
plot(x,y,'x',x,A*c,'-')
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fa8sV.png" alt="linreg" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 14 - graphs</h3>
<pre><code>gplot(graph,x)
</code></pre>
<p>That is how to plot a graph. <code>graph</code> should contain a square adjacency matrix and <code>x</code> should be a nx2 matrix that contains the coordinates of each node. Lets make a random graph: <code>graph = triu( rand(8)&gt;.7)</code> (make a Matrix that contains 0s and 1s, get only the upper triangle for an interesting graph). <code>x = rand(8,2)</code> then plot with some fancy styles <code>gplot(graph,x,'k-.d')</code></p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WE7ae.png" alt="graph" /> (I declare this as modern art.)</p>
<h3>Snippet 13 - meshgrid</h3>
<pre><code>meshgrid(a,b)
</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the most awesomest functions, simple but useful. If you want to plot a real valued function depending on two variables, you can just define a vector of values for the x-axis and one for the y-axis (a and b). Then with meshgrid, you can create two matrices of the size len(a) x len(b) where one has only the vector <code>a</code> as column, and the other has only the column has only the vectors <code>b</code> as rows. Usage example:<code>a = -3:0.2:3;[x,y]=meshgrid(a)</code> (if both vectors are the same, it is sufficient to just pass one.) Then you can just type <code>z=x.^2+-y.^2</code> and e.g. <code>mesh(x,y,z)</code>. This works for an arbitrary number of dimensions! So this is not only great for plotting, but also for getting all possible combinations of different vectors etc... (So, if you want to create a new code golf language, this should be in there, just make sure you use a shorter function name...)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WQDAC.png" alt="mesh" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 12 - plotting</h3>
<pre><code>plot(x,x.^2)
</code></pre>
<p>Take a vector <code>x=-3:0.5:3</code> and and let <code>plot</code> do the rest. There are many more functions for plotting this is just a very basic one that you can use all the time. It would be already enough to write <code>plot(v)</code> and the data in <code>v</code> will be plotted against the array indices. How simple is that? If you want to style your plot, just add a string as a third argument: e.g. <code>'r:o'</code> will make a red, dotted line with circles around the data points. If you want multiple plots, just add more arguments, or use matrices instead of vectors. Foolproof. <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v4JtZ.png" alt="plot" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 11 - function handles</h3>
<pre><code>f=@(x,y)x+y
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of a function handle that gets stored in <code>f</code>. Now you can call <code>f(1,2)</code> and get <code>3</code>. Function handles in matlab are very useful for math functions (e.g. plotting) and you can define them in one line. But one drawback is that you cannot have conditionals or piecewise (and therefore no recursion). If you want this, you have to use the <code>function</code> statement and declare a new function, and each of those has to be stored in a separate file... (WHYYYYYY????)</p>
<p>PS: You'll get another funny easter egg if you type <code>why</code> in the console: They made a huge function that produces random messages like:</p>
<pre><code>The tall system manager obeyed some engineer.
The programmer suggested it.
It's your karma.
A tall and good and not excessively rich and bald and very smart and good tall and tall and terrified and rich and not very terrified and smart and tall and young hamster insisted on it.
</code></pre>
<p>...which is very comforting if you are desperate enough to ask the console <code>why</code>...</p>
<h3>Snippet 10 - How does my matrix look?</h3>
<pre><code>spy(eye(9))
</code></pre>
<p>As you know by now <code>eye(9)</code> creates a 9x9 identity matrix. <code>spy</code> just creates a that shows the zero/nonzero entries of the matrix. But you can also use it for displaying any binary 2d data. If you call <code>spy</code> without argument you'll get a nice little easter egg=)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1uLLs.png" alt="spy on identity" /> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yF1Wh.png" alt="spy easteregg" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 9</h3>
<pre><code>kron(a,b)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>kron</code> function evaluates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product" rel="noreferrer">Kronecker product</a> of two matrices. This is very useful for discretisized multidimensional linear operators. I also used it every now and then for code golfing. You want all possible products of the entries of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>? <code>kron(a,b)</code>, here you go.</p>
<h3>Snippet 8</h3>
<pre><code>5*a\b.*b
</code></pre>
<p>Ok here I mixed up 3 different operator. You can multiply any matrix by a scalar by just using <code>*</code>. (Then every entry of the matrix gets multiplied by that scalar). But <code>*</code> also performs matrix multiplications. If you prepend a dot you get the <code>.*</code> operator, this one multiplies two matrices of the same size but <em>entry wise</em>. (This can also be done with division operators like <code>/</code> and <code>\</code>.)</p>
<p>Next, the backslash operator can be used as left division (in contrast to <code>/</code> which performs right division as you are used to) but it is also the most powerful and characteristic operator of matlab: It performs a 'matrix division'. Lets say you have the system of linear equations <code>A*x=b</code> and you want to solve it for <code>x</code>, then you can just type <code>x=A\b</code>. And <code>\</code> (you can also use <code>/</code> but that is less common for matrices) first quickly analyzes the matrix, and uses the results to find the fastest algorithm to perform this inversion-multiplication! (See e.g. <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/18553210">here</a>)</p>
<p>But you can also use it for under- or over-defined systems (where the there exists no inverse or where the matrix isn't even square, e.g. for least squares method). This really is <strong>the magic wand</strong> of matlab.</p>
<h3>Snippet 7</h3>
<pre><code>[a,b;c]
</code></pre>
<p>Ok that does not look like much, but it is a very convenient tool: Matrix concatenation. A comma between two expressions means that they get concatenated horizontally (that means they have to have the same height) and a semicolon means that the previous 'line' will be above the next 'line' (by line I mean everything between two semicolons. Just a simple example:  <code>a = [1,2;3,4]; b = [5;6]; c =[7,8,9]; d=[a,b;c];</code> will result in the same <code>d</code> as <code>d=[1,2,5; 3,5,6; 7,8,9]</code>. (Get it?)</p>
<h3>Snipped 6</h3>
<pre><code>eye(7)
</code></pre>
<p>This function produces a full 7x7 identity matrix. It is that easy. There are other functions like <code>nan,inf,ones,zeros,rand,randi,randn</code> that work the very same way. (If you pass two arguments you can set the height/width of the resulting matrix.) As I will show later, you can easily create and (and in a very visual way) concatenate matrices (2d-arrays) which is sooo damn useful and easy if you have to numerically solve partial differential equations. (When you solve PDEs the general approach is discretisizig the derivative operators, basically you will get just a huge system of linear equations that needs to be solved. These matrices normally are sparse (only very few non-zero elements) and have some kind of symmetry. That's why you can easily 'compose' the matrix you need.</p>
<h3>Snippet 5</h3>
<pre><code>a(a&gt;0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>I hope you are not getting tired by all the ways of accessing arrays. This shows an easy way to get all elements of an array that meet some conditions. In this case you get a vector of all elements of <code>a</code> that are greater than 0.5. The expression <code>a&gt;0.5</code> just returns a matrix of the same size as <code>a</code> with ones for each element that satisfies the condition and a <code>0</code> for each element that doesn't.</p>
<h3>Snippet 4</h3>
<pre><code>a(:)
</code></pre>
<p>This again just returns the contents of <code>a</code> as a column vector (nx1 matrix). This is nice if you do not know whether you stored your data as column or row vector, or if your data is two dimensional (e.g. for 2d finite differences methods).</p>
<h3>Snippet 3</h3>
<pre><code>1:9
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily make vectors (in this case 1xn matrices) with the semicolon operator. In this case you get the vector <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]</code>. This is also particularly nice for accessing slices of other vectors as e.g. <code>a(2:4)</code> accesses the second, third and fourth element of the vector <code>a</code>. You can also use it with a step size, like <code>0:0.5:10</code> or so.</p>
<h3>Snippet 2</h3>
<pre><code>i;
</code></pre>
<p>A semicolon suppresses output to console. You can see it as a good or a bad thing, but I like it for debugging stuff. Any line of calculation etc. will automatically print its result to the console, as long as you do not suppress the output by a semicolon.</p>
<h3>Snippet 1</h3>
<pre><code>i
</code></pre>
<p>Complex number are a basic number type. (Too bad many people use <code>i</code> as a counting variable in for loops in which case it gets overridden.)</p>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>For those who do not know, MatLab is a programming language (with nice IDE that is also called MatLab?) that is first of all intended for numerical calculations* and data manipulation. (There is an open source counterpart called &quot;Octave&quot;) As it is only** interpreted it is not very fast, but it's strength are that you can easily manipulate matrices and many algorithms are implemented in an optimized way such that they run pretty fast when applied on matrices. It also is a very easy language to learn, but I do not recommend it as a starter language as you will assume pretty bad 'programming' habits.</p>
<p>*As it is a interpreted language it can be very slow for expensive projects, but you have built-in parallelization methods, and you can also use multiple computers together to run a program. But if you really wanna get fast I think you still depend on C or Fortran or crazy stuff like that. But still many implemented algorithms (matrix multiplication, solving systems of linear equations etc) are heavily optimized and perform quite well. But if you program the same algorithms in Matlab itself, you're gonna have to wait=) (Something really unintuitive when you come from other languages is that if you vectorize your operations instead of using for loops, you can save much time in Matlab.)</p>
<p>**You can sort of compile your programs, but that mainly converts the source code to an unreadable file (for humans), that is not that much faster when executed.</p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>The only valid characters in NO! are <code>NOno!?</code>. This language was created 2 hours ago and I'm currently writing this with my 12th cup of coffee in my hand. This language is close to the antithesis of code golf as demonstrated by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/114877/66833">this</a> answer to the <code>Hello, World!</code> challenge.</p>

<div id="pu65" class="pu"><h1>ActionScript 3</h1>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>AS3 is a scripting language designed to be used in client games and applications. It's a fully object oriented language that features dynamic objects that can be changed at run time, just like JavaScript.</p>

<h2>1-length code</h2>

<pre><code>7
</code></pre>

<p>Each number in AS3 is treated as an object.</p>

<h2>2-length code</h2>

<pre><code>as
</code></pre>

<p>AS3 is a strongly typed language; this is how to perform casting.</p>

<h2>3-length code</h2>

<pre><code>int
</code></pre>

<p>This is one of the two number types that AS3 contains. The designers of the language preferred to make it simple and included just two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>64-bit <code>float</code> for long values and floating points.</li>
<li>32-bit <code>int</code> for integers, perhaps for performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5-length code</h2>

<pre><code>a:*=1
</code></pre>

<p>In AS3, functions may have optional values; in this code snippet, 1 is assigned to <code>a</code> if no other value been passed to the function. The value after the <code>:</code> represents the type of <code>a</code>; in this case it's <code>*</code>, which means it can have any value. The difference between <code>*</code> and <code>object</code> is that <code>*</code> can also have undefined type. This is how Adobe <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/LiveCycleMosaic/9.0/actionscript/specialTypes.html#*" rel="nofollow noreferrer">explains</a> it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you want to defer type checking to runtime, you can use an untyped property or expression to circumvent compile-time type checking in strict mode. Note, however, that runtime type checking of assignment statements occurs whether you use strict mode or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>9-length-ish code</h2>

<pre><code>trace("a",0)
</code></pre>

<p><code>trace</code> is the best logging mechanism ever! You don't need to care about the type you are passing to the <code>trace</code> not the number of the params, it will simply print it all back to you, separated with a space char.</p>

<p><b>Factoid:</b></p>
<p>In Brain-Flak a one is shorter than zero and multiplying by seven takes more characters than multiplying by eight.</p>
<p><em>Since Brain-Flak programs must have an even number of characters I have added some programs with extra spaces for the odd length snippets.  These are not well golfed intentionally but rather put there in an attempt to give you a little more for your kind upvotes.</em></p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It switches to the offstack.  As a single program this will always output nothing regardless of the inputs.</p>
<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>{ }
</code></pre>
<p>This is the <code>{}</code> nilad it pops top item on the stack and returns its value.  As a full program it just removes the last item input.</p>
<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>(())
</code></pre>
<p>This program pushes one to the top of the stack.  This is the shortest way to express 1 in Brain-Flak.</p>
<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>([ ])
</code></pre>
<p>This program pushes the stack height to the top of the stack.  At the start of a program it acts like <code>argc</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 6 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}{})
</code></pre>
<p>This program adds two numbers.</p>
<p>It pops the top two elements and pushes the sum.</p>
<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>
<p>This one requires a <code>-d</code> flag to run so +3 bytes</p>
<p>(This one also doesn't work on try it online)</p>
<pre><code>@ij 
</code></pre>
<p>This is the injection flag! (With a space after it because it needs to be length 7)</p>
<p>This halts the program takes a Brain-Flak program from STDIN and runs it as part of the code.  Its my favorite flag and (arguably) Brain-Flak's shortest self interpreter.  <code>@ij</code> flags can be nested</p>
<h3>Length 8 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}&lt;&gt;)&lt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet moves the top of the current stack to the other stack.  It is a useful component of many programs.  It starts by opening a push with <code>(</code> pops the first value with <code>{}</code>, moves to the other stack using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> and puts the popped value down using <code>)</code>.  When that is done it moves back to the original stack with a <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 9 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}[()]) 
</code></pre>
<p><em>(One space after the program makes it 9 characters)</em></p>
<p>This snippet decrements the top of the stack by one.  It works by popping the top of the stack with <code>{}</code> and adding it to the negative of <code>()</code> (-1) and then pushing the result back on the stack.</p>
<h3>Length 10 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>{({}&lt;&gt;)&lt;&gt;}
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet will move values from one stack to another until it encounters a zero.  In many programs where it is known that the stack does not contain a zero this is used as a cheap stack reverse.</p>
<h3>Length 12 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}&lt;({}())&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>We've finally gotten long enough snippets that we can show off the usefulness of the <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> monad. This program increments the number underneath the top of the stack, while leaving the TOS intact. This approach can be extended. For example, this will increment the number second from the top of the stack:</p>
<pre><code>({}&lt;({}&lt;({}())&gt;)&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>In general, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>'({}&lt;' * n + &lt;code&gt; + '&gt;)' * n
</code></pre>
<p>to run <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> on the number that's <em>n</em> from the top without affecting the rest of the stack.</p>

<div id="pu67" class="pu"><h1>tinylisp</h1>

<h2>Factoid:</h2>

<p><code>tinylisp</code> is a language made by @DLosc for an "interpret this language" challenge. Its intent is to demonstrate what a Lisp-like language can do using only very few builtins.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dloscutoff/Esolangs/blob/master/tinylisp/tinylisp.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is an interpreter.</p>

<h2>Snippet 1:</h2>

<pre><code>d
</code></pre>

<p>This single character is perhaps the most used builtin in tinylisp: the <code>def</code> builtin. It can be used to define variables and functions, and is basically required for every tinylisp program. Like any other lisp-like language, you define things like this:</p>

<pre><code>(d x 10) // Creates a new variable x, and sets it to 10
(d succ  // Successor function, will be properly covered later
  (q (
    (x)
    (s 1 (s 0 x)))))
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 2:</h2>

<pre><code>()
</code></pre>

<p>Everything in tinylisp (and basically most Lisp-like languages) are built off of parentheses. In tinylisp, these parentheses define an empty list - which is one of three data types in tinylisp:</p>

<ul>
<li>Symbols</li>
<li>Numbers (which will be covered in the next snippet)</li>
<li>Lists</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 3:</h2>

<pre><code>1.5
</code></pre>

<p>tinylisp has numbers, but surprisingly enough, this is not a number. Numbers (at least, numbers you can type down before compilation) in tinylisp only have the characters <code>0-9</code> in them, and anything else is a name, so these "numbers" aren't numbers in tinylisp:</p>

<pre><code>-13    (contains -)
.335   (contains .)
17,232 (contains ,)
</code></pre>

<p><em>There's currently no way to define floats in tinylisp, however I'm working on implementing a fraction "class" thing in tinylisp. - Qwerp-Derp</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 4:</h2>

<pre><code>disp
</code></pre>

<p>This is a four-character builtin in tinylisp, however most builtins are only one character (see snippet <code>1</code> for an example). This basically returns a value to STDOUT, with a trailing newline.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 5:</h2>

<pre><code>(v 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, finally, a full statement that actually evaluates to something!</p>

<p>This e<code>v</code>aluates the number <code>1</code>, and therefore returns <code>1</code>. That's simple enough - more complicated examples are to come.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 6:</h2>

<pre><code>(q(1))
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet <code>q</code>uotes the list <code>(1)</code>, and therefore evaluates to <code>(1)</code>. I'm doing the best I can with 6 bytes...</p>

<p><code>q</code> basically takes anything, and then returns the same thing, unevaluated. So for a program like this:</p>

<pre><code>(q (s 1 2))
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of returning <code>3</code>, it returns <code>(s 1 2)</code> instead.</p>

<h2>Snippet 7:</h2>

<pre><code>(s 1 2)
</code></pre>

<p><code>s</code> is the subtraction builtin; more specifically, it subtracts two integers. The above returns <code>-1</code>. Incidentally, <code>s</code> is the only way to get negative numbers in tinylisp (compare snippet 3).</p>

<p><a href="https://tio.run/nexus/tinylisp#@69RrGCoYKT5/z8A" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="tinylisp – TIO Nexus">Try it online!</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 8:</h2>

<pre><code>(q(()1))
</code></pre>

<p>This is the simplest example of a lambda in tinylisp, and is essential to both evaluating other things and creating functions. The structure of lambdas is like so:</p>

<pre><code>(q (  ;; Lambdas have to be quoted using "q", so not to get evaluated
  ()  ;; A list of arguments, in this example there are 0 args, so
      ;; this is an empty list
  1   ;; The "body" of the lambda: in this case, we're returning 1
      ;; for every input.
))
</code></pre>

<p>This statement is essentially similar to the Python lambda <code>lambda:1</code> (which is also 8 bytes long, coincidentally). It can be used like so:</p>

<pre><code>( (q(()1)) )  ;; evaluates to 1
</code></pre>

<p>This shows off two new instructions (There are in fact only two unique ones in the program). These are the repeat <code>V</code> and the print_grid <code>.X</code> functions.</p>
<p><code>V</code> takes an integer or iterable and repeats the code the length of that iterable or the number of times. It takes the whole stack and when it loops, the current stack is kept and fed as input. If an iterable is passed, it also pushes that iterable at the beginning.</p>
<p><code>.X</code> is a special function in that it will probably only be used in challenges requiring a strict output format. It takes a string (with optional newlines) and pads it so it is in a grid-like format. It also optionally takes up to 8 characters to pad with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0: upper (all characters have this as default)</p>
<p>1: topleft (corners if undefined have this)</p>
<p>2: left line</p>
<p>3: right line</p>
<p>4: lower line</p>
<p>5: topright corner</p>
<p>6: bottomright corner</p>
<p>7: bottomleft corner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If no characters are given, it defaults to surrounding the entire thing with spaces. The program can stop defining extra characters by ending with a <code>&quot;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>V           - repeat number of times:
 .X&quot;        -  surround with spaces
    .X-+||&quot; -  surround in a ascii box

<p>Infinite lists are effectively Python's generators. At the end of a Pyke program, all infinite lists on the stack are unwound as far as it will go in the time limit available (or none if done offline). Pyke has operators to filter and map nodes to infinite lists as well as combine them in various ways. Infinite lists are a relatively new feature and have been used in several short answers.</p>

<p>This program is the beginning in a chain of programs which output larger versions of themselves. </p>

<p>This program pushes <code>95</code>, copies (<code>&amp;</code>) it, then pushes <code>34</code>. <code>_</code> prints the stack's values, and <code>"</code> prints it again but as a string, resulting in:</p>

<pre><code>95 95 34

</code></pre>

<p>Which in turn outputs:</p>

<pre><code>95 95 34
95 95 34
__"
</code></pre>

<p>5 or so iterations later, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34
95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34

<p>This is in fact an adaption of my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/104293/60919">asterisk triangle</a> answer. Given an integer, for example <code>n = 5</code>, it prints a "d-triangle" of this size:</p>

<pre><code>d

<p>This is a concise example of both loops and char-code conversion in Pushy:</p>

<pre><code>:    \ Input times do (consuming input):
 H   \   Push 100 to the stack (character code for 'd')
  "  \   Print the whole stack, as a string.
</code></pre>

<p>As each iteration pushes a new <code>'d'</code>, this creates a triangle.</p>

<p>Notice there is no "end-loop" delimiter: this is normally signified with a <code>;</code>. However, the interpreter automatically assumes these to be at the end of the program if omitted.</p>

<p>Click on any snippet's header to try it in the <a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter</a>!</p>

<p>For reference, <strong>the text in bold tells you the important stuff.</strong></p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Cubix is a stack-based language, created by me, which runs like a 2D language such as Befunge. The main difference? <strong>The code is run on the outside of a cube.</strong></p>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=QA==&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 1</a></h3>

<pre><code>@
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty much the character most commonly used. Why? Because <strong>it immediately ends execution of the program.</strong> In fact, it's the only way to end the program.</p>

<p>This is useless as a program, though, because it gets turned into this cube:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;. . . .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>Where the IP (instruction pointer) is started at the arrow, and <code>.</code> is a no-op. This just loops around forever. Take a good look and you'll see why <em>every</em> possible 1-byte program never ends (or does anything at all).</p>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=Lk8=&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 2</a></h3>

<pre><code>.O
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we've gotten over the length-1 barrier, we can finally see some output! Here's the cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   .
&gt;O . . .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>where the IP starts at the arrow. <strong><code>O</code> takes the TOS (top-of-stack) and outputs it as a number.</strong> If the stack is empty (e.g. at the beginning of the program), this prints <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>When the IP gets over to the right edge of the above cube-net, it wraps back around to the left edge, onto the <code>O</code> again. Thus, this program prints <code>0</code> forever.</p>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=QE8v&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 3</a></h3>

<pre><code>@O/
</code></pre>

<p>Our first <s>cheerleader</s> program that terminates! This gets mapped to the following net:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;O / . .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>where the IP starts at the arrow. As we've seen before, the <code>O</code> prints the TOS, which is currently <code>0</code>, as a number. Next comes a new character: <code>/</code>. This is a mirror. There are five different mirrors: <code>/</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>_</code>, and <code>T</code>. <strong>Mirrors reflect the IP from one direction to another.</strong></p>

<p>When the IP hits this mirror, it is redirected to the north. This puts it on the top face, which is <code>@</code>. Thus, the program is terminated, and the output is <code>0</code>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=QElvXg==&amp;input=NjU=&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 4</a></h3>

<pre><code>@Io^
</code></pre>

<p>This expands into the following cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;I o ^ .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>A bunch of new characters here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first character is <code>I</code>, which <strong>inputs an integer from STDIN</strong>.</li>
<li>Next comes <code>o</code>. This is like <code>O</code>, but <strong>outputs a char-code</strong> instead of an integer.</li>
<li>After that, we see <code>^</code>. This is one of four arrows: <code>^</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>v</code>, and <code>&lt;</code>. <strong>Arrows point the IP in a specific direction.</strong> <code>^</code> points the IP north, where it hits the <code>@</code> and terminates.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>@i?o_
</code></pre>

<p>Finally a (somewhat) useful program. This expands into the following cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;i ? o _
   .
</code></pre>

<p>This is a <code>cat</code> program: it prints the entirety of the input, one char at a time.</p>

<p>The first character is <code>i</code>, which <strong>inputs a char-code from STDIN</strong>. If there's nothing in STDIN, it pushes <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>Next comes <code>?</code>. This is one of the most useful chars: <strong>it redirects the IP based on the sign of the TOS.</strong> If the TOS is negative, the IP turns left; if the TOS is positive, the IP turns right; if the TOS is zero, the IP continues in the same direction.</p>

<p>The combination of these chars does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the input is a null byte, the IP continues straight, outputting with <code>o</code> and wrapping back around to the <code>i</code>. (The <code>_</code> is a mirror which does nothing when the IP is traveling east-west.)</li>
<li>If the input is anything else, the IP turns right, wrapping around to the bottom and hitting the <code>_</code>. This turns it around; it goes back across the bottom and hits the <code>?</code> again, turning right. This time, though, it's sent through the <code>o</code> and back around to the <code>i</code>.</li>
<li>If there is no more input, the IP turns left, hits <code>@</code>, and ends the program.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=OU8vOylv&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 6</a></h3>

<pre><code>9O/;)o
</code></pre>

<p>Our first happy program! <code>;)</code> This expands into the following cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   9
&gt;O / ; )
   o
</code></pre>

<p>The first character is <code>O</code>, which prints the TOS (currently <code>0</code>). Then the IP hits a mirror <code>/</code> which redirects it over the top face onto the <code>9</code>. <strong>Digits push themselves to the stack.</strong> Note that they do not concatenate; <code>12</code> pushes a <code>1</code> and a <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>So now the TOS is <code>9</code>. The IP comes down on the other side of the cube and hits the <code>)</code>, which <strong>increments the TOS by 1.</strong> Now the TOS is 10, which tells the <code>o</code> on the bottom face to output a newline.</p>

<p>The IP comes up and hits the mirror again, turning to the east. The next character it hits is the <code>;</code>, which <strong>pops the TOS (removes it).</strong> The stack is now back to its natural state with infinite <code>0</code>s. </p>

<p>Next is the <code>)</code>, which increments the TOS to 1. Now the IP is back at the start of the program, except the TOS is now <code>1</code> instead of <code>0</code>. Can you figure out what this program does?</p>

<div id="pu72" class="pu"><h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0R1Jgqp8Gg4cVJCZkRkdEthZDQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">QBIC</a></h2>

<p>I'm trying to teach QuickBasic to do codegolf (and myself in the process), so I'm creating the language Quick Basic Interpreter for Codegolf, or QBIC for short.</p>

<p><strong>0 byte factoid</strong></p>

<p>Most of QBIC's strength lies in just making a shorthand for QBasic's expansive syntax, but I've also incorporated several features of my own. When generating the trans-compiled BAS file, a standard header is imported that implements some of these features. For instance, the numbers 1 through 10 get initialised as variables <code>q</code> through <code>z</code>. This occasionally saves me some bytes when initialising a FOR loop, and shaves a byte off of using <code>10</code>.</p>

<p><strong>1 byte</strong></p>

<pre><code>}
</code></pre>

<p>The above statement will do ... exactly nothing. When found in the QBIC code, it wil automatically add END IF's, NEXTs and LOOPs for every opened IF/FOR/DO construct it finds (in the correct order, naturally). Note that <code>]</code> does the same for one language construct, where <code>}</code> closes all opened constructs.</p>

<p>However, since we've not yet opened any of those constructs, this does nothing and results in an 'empty' Qbasic BAS file. Also, at the end of compiling QBIC, the compiler will run this statement automatically.</p>

<p><strong>2 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>?z
</code></pre>

<p>This will write 10 on the screen. In QBIC, the letters of the lower-case alphabet are references to numerical variables. This is retained from QBasic, where <code>PRINT a</code> would give me a <code>0</code> on the screen (even without ever defining <code>a</code>). In addition, QBIC initialises q-z to be 1 through 10 by default. The <code>?</code> is obviously shorthand for the <code>PRINT</code> statement and writes to screen.</p>

<p><strong>3 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>_Xb
</code></pre>

<p><code>_X</code> can be used to terminate a program, and when used with a suffix, it will print something on exit. Suffixes can be A-Z (which refers to string variables A$ - Z$) or lowercase a-z (for the numerical vars of this name). The example snippet ends the program, and prints variable <code>b</code> to screen before it turns off the lights.</p>

<p><strong>4 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>?_r|
</code></pre>

<p><code>_r</code> is a random number generator. By itself, it will generate a random number between 0 and 10 and, in this case, print it. We can also add one or two parameters for a different lower and upper bound; If only one is specified, that's our new upper bound.<br>
<code>_r20|</code> will generate a number between 0 and 20.<br>
<code>_r5,18|</code> will generate a number between 5 and 18. 
The statement <code>_R</code> is equivalent to <code>_r</code> with one exception: <code>_R</code> assigns to a variable, <code>_r</code> does not:</p>

<pre><code>?_r|    PRINT getNextRandomNumber(0, 10)
_R|?a   a = getNextRandomNumber(0, 10) : PRINT a
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>:_Ra|
</code></pre>

<p>The above snippet introduces the <code>:</code>, which reads the first unread command line parameter and assigns it to the first available numeric var. The resulting QBasic code for this snippet is:</p>

<pre><code>a = assignCMDToNum!
b = getRandomNumber(0, a)
</code></pre>

<p>There's also <code>;</code>, which does the same for string variables.</p>

<p><strong>6 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>?!z$+A
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we see a cast in action. QBasic is kinda picky when it comes to data types. Adding a string to an integer will result in errors. To work around this, I've added a casting function. The above snippet will print <code>10</code> (<code>z</code> is auto-initialised to <code>10</code>) and append whatever is in the variable <code>A$</code>. For instance, a full program could be</p>

<pre><code>#test`?!z$+A
</code></pre>

<p>and the result then is <code>10test</code>.</p>

<p>Casting is done using the <code>!</code> symbol. It then casts everything between the <code>!</code> and the delimiter. Usually <code>|</code> is the delimiter for variable-length arguments, but CAST uses either a <code>$</code> to perform the cast from number to string, or another <code>!</code> to cast a string to number.</p>

<p><strong>7 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>Z=_f_tA
</code></pre>

<p>Lot going on here. Let's work on the assumption that <code>A$</code> already holds a value, say "  Hello  " (significant spaces). This snippet then sets <code>Z$</code> to the reversed (<code>_f</code>), trimmed (<code>_t</code>) version of <code>A$</code>, <code>olleH</code> and prints it to the screen.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The behaviour between <code>_f</code> and <code>_F</code> is different: <code>_F</code> declares a variable and assigns its output to it, <code>_f</code> only gives the output and assigning is done by other parts of the script. The same goes for <code>_r</code> in my 5-byte snippet. This is called <strong>ULX</strong>, or Upper-Lowercase Extension. Whether or not output gets auto-assigned is one of the behavioural changes ULX can bring, but there are other examples. <code>_D</code>, for intance, yields the system date, <code>_d</code> yelds system time. Both don't auto-assign.</p></li>
<li><p><code>_t</code> removes the whitespace on both sides of its argument. <code>_u</code> does a left-trim, <code>_v</code> does right-trim. All three support ULX, and for all three this switches between auto-assign (uppercase) or output only (lowercase).</p></li>
<li><p>Both <code>_f</code> and <code>_t</code> should be delimited with <code>|</code> to signify the end of the parameter list. However, since EOF is reached, the correct number of <code>|</code>'s get added to close all opened parameter lists. If this statement would have been followed by the closing commands for language constructs (<code>]</code>or <code>}</code>, see byte 1) those same <code>|</code>'s would get added.</p></li>
<li><p>QBIC allows for the result of one function to be the input for the next: <code>_f</code> takes as input the result of <code>_t</code></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if we would run this program, it would actually print <code>olleH</code>, despite we never use a <code>?</code> or <code>_X*</code> statement. This is because QBIC implicitly prints the contents of Z$ on exit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Summarizing, the above 7-byte snippet would roughly compile into this QBasic block:</p>

<pre><code>FUNCTION revstring$(in$)
  ... function definition imported through QBIC.H
END FUNCTION 

... we set A$ to be "  Hello  "

Z$ = revstring$(LTRIM$(RTRIM$(A$)))

PRINT Z$
</code></pre>

<p><strong>8 bytes</strong></p>

<p>Let's look at literals. There are 2 types in QBIC: String literals (Verbal and Silent) and Code Literals. They are started with <code>@</code>, <code>#</code> and <code>'</code> respectively, are terminated with ```. Using a <code>&amp;boxul;</code> respresents a line-break.</p>

<pre><code>?@check`  --&gt; Verbal string literal: Defines A$ in the header, assign the value "check" 
              to it, and insert A$ in the body of the resulting QBasic at this moment. 
#10`?A+A  --&gt; Silent literal: Defines the literal A$ as "10", but doesn't insert `A$` 
              in the QBasic output at this time. This sample then prints "1010"; `+`in 
              this context is string concatenation.
'SQR(9)`  --&gt; Code literal: from the `'`(which would be seen as a comment by QBasic) to
              the ``` is not stored as a variable, but passed unaltered to the resulting 
              QBasic. This particular statement calculates the root of 9.

<div id="pu75" class="pu"><h1>Racket</h1>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong> : A programmable programming language: Racket is a full-spectrum programming language. It goes beyond Lisp and Scheme with dialects that support objects, types, laziness, and more. (<a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://racket-lang.org/</a>) </p>

<p>(I am surprised no one has added Racket till now).</p>

<p>Functions or procedures need to be in parentheses. First term in parentheses is procedure name, rest are its arguments. If an argument is a procedure, it has to be in its own brackets. Values (non-procedures) are written without brackets. </p>

<p>Main syntax difference between Java and Racket is f(a, b) vs (f a b), x+y+z vs (+ x y z), x == y vs (eq? x y) and x=2 vs (define x 2), or if already defined, (set! x 2). There is no need to declare types like public static void or int char string etc. </p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>i
</code></pre>

<p>Prints value of i.</p>

<p>Also: + - / * are functions: </p>

<pre><code>(+ 1 2 3 4)  
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 10 (all numbers are added together)</p>

<pre><code>(* 1 2 3 4)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 24 (product of all numbers)</p>

<pre><code>(/ 20 5 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 2 (20 is divided by 5 as well as 2)</p>

<pre><code>(- 10 5 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 3 (5 and 2 are subtracted from 10)</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>pi
</code></pre>

<p>Prints value of pi: </p>

<pre><code>3.141592653589793
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<pre><code>let 
</code></pre>

<p>For local binding as in: </p>

<pre><code>(let ( (x 5)   (y 10) )
  (println  (* x y))
)
; x and y are not visible here; 
</code></pre>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>map
</code></pre>

<p>Subjects each item of a list to the sent function, e.g. to double every item of the list:</p>

<pre><code>(map    (lambda(x) (* 2 x))    (list 1 2 3) )
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>'(2 4 6)
</code></pre>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>for 
</code></pre>

<p>Standard for loop as well as its extensions: </p>

<pre><code>for* for/list for/sum for/product for/first for/last for/and for/or 
</code></pre>

<p>There are more extensions <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html</a> !</p>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<p>Conditionals: </p>

<pre><code>cond 
</code></pre>

<p>For example (from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/racket-cheat/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.racket-lang.org/racket-cheat/index.html</a>): </p>

<pre><code>(cond 
  [(even? x) 0] 
  [(odd? x) 1] 
  [else "impossible!"]) 
</code></pre>

<p>Also</p>

<pre><code>list
</code></pre>

<p>Being derived from Lisp &amp; Scheme, list is very important data structure here:</p>

<pre><code>(list 1 "a" #\a (list 1 2 3)) 
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<pre><code>match 
</code></pre>

<p>Match is like case-switch: </p>

<pre><code>(match x
  [3 (displayln "x is 3")]
  [4 (displayln "x is 4")]
  [5 (displayln "x is 5")]
  [default (displayln "none of the above")])
</code></pre>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>apply 
</code></pre>

<p>This opens a list and provides all elements to the function, for example: </p>

<pre><code>(apply + (list 1 2 3 4 5))
</code></pre>

<p>becomes: </p>

<pre><code>(+ 1 2 3 4 5) ; =&gt; 15
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 6</h2>

<p>Define: a very basic function- to assign value to a variable: </p>

<pre><code>(define s "A string")
(define n 10)
</code></pre>

<p>Also:<br>
printf - the print function: </p>

<pre><code>(printf "~a ; ~a ~n" s n)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: </p>

<pre><code>A string ; 10 
</code></pre>

<p>Also: Filter - a function that filters a list for items which give true value to the specified function (sent as an argument):  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; (filter string? (list "a" "b" 6))
'("a" "b")
&gt; (filter positive? (list 1 -2 6 7 0))
'(1 6 7)
</code></pre>

<p>The test function can be specified: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; (filter 
    (lambda(x) (&gt; x 2))    ; function to test each element
    '(1 2 3 4 5))          ; full input list to be filtered
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>'(3 4 5)                   ; output list of elements greater than 2
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 7</h2>

<p>println : one of most commonly used function. Prints out the sent string with a newline character at end: </p>

<pre><code>(println "String to be printed")
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: examples are from various sources on the net).</p>

<div id="pu76" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://github.com/LogicodeLang/Logicode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Logicode</a></h1>
<h2>Factoid:</h2>
<p>Logicode has a very limited amount of built-ins (7 built-ins, of which 6 are single-char), which makes it pretty difficult to program anything meaningful in.</p>
<p>Also, it's built on logic gates, as the name suggests, and that's it - which makes it doubly hard to code stuff in.</p>
<p>You can try it online <a href="http://logicode.tryitonline.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Length 1 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>+
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>+</code> is not addition, as that can be achieved easily. It's concatenation between two &quot;numbers&quot; (which are binary): So, something like <code>11+1</code> is not <code>100</code>, as with regular binary addition, but <code>111</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 2 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>-&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>-&gt;</code> is used in two main things: circuits (which are Logicode's version of functions) and conditionals (<code>if</code> statements). It is used to separate the executed code from the arguments (in the case of circuits) or the condition (in the case of conditionals).</p>
<h2>Length 3 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>out
</code></pre>
<p>This is a declarer, kinda like <code>var</code> in Javascript to declare a new variable. Logicode has a declarer for anything: <code>out</code> for output, <code>var</code> for variables, <code>circ</code> for circuits (which are basically functions in Logicode), <code>cond</code> for conditionals.</p>
<h2>Length 4 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>!100
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>!</code> is a logical NOT, which is operated on every digit of the binary string that follows. In this case, the snippet evaluates to <code>011</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 5 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>1&amp;1&amp;1
</code></pre>
<p>In Logicode, you're allowed to stack multiple two-arg (dyadic) operators together, as seen here. The <code>&amp;</code> is a logical AND, and the snippet evaluates to <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 6 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>@11011
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, ASCII support! Because the default &quot;type&quot; of Logicode is binary strings, the <code>@</code> converts binary to ASCII codes (mod 256). In this case, the character generated is <code>ESC</code> (ASCII character code 27).</p>
<h2>Length 7 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>1000&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes the tail of <code>1000</code> three times. A tail is essentially every character but the first, so repeating this three times gives us:</p>
<pre><code>1000 -&gt; 000 -&gt; 00 -&gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>So this evaluates to 0.</p>

<div id="pu79" class="pu"><h1>///</h1>

<p>/// is a minimalist Turing-complete esoteric programming language. The only operation is repeated string substitution, using the syntax <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>.</p>

<pre><code>\n

<p>This won't print a newline.

<pre><code>/☃//

<p>This attempts to replace a snowman with nothing/remove every snowman. Since the entire source code, except the <code>/☃//</code> part, doesn't contain a snowman, it doesn't do anything.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Length 4</strong> ★</p>

<pre><code>/ //

<pre><code>☃/☃//
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet is important for showing one thing: string substitution doesn't work on anything that comes before the <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>.</p>

<p>If you take a look at snippet length 4, it removes every snowman. But that won't work if there are snowmen before the <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>, so he stays there and get printed.</p>

<p>However, this snippet would remove the snowman, because the snowman comes after the <code>/pattern/replacement/</code> part: <a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy8v4piD&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><code>/☃//☃</code></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Length 5</strong> ★</p>

<pre><code>/\///

<p>This snippet completely breaks the language. It works by removing every <code>/</code>.</p>

<pre><code>/
/☃/
(newline)
</code></pre>

<p>Remember the second snippet? Instead of writing <code>\n</code>, you use a literal new line.</p>

<p>Because Markdown apparently doesn't like empty lines of code, you have to remove the <code>(newline)</code> part when trying this in <a href="http://tryitonline.net" rel="noreferrer">Try it online!</a> or any other /// interpreter.</p>

<p>You probably guessed it by now, but I'll explain it anyways. The <code>/\n/☃/</code> part replaces every newline with a snowman. Since there's a trailing new line in the snippet, it gets replaced by a snowman and printed.</p>

<p>This is probably kinda boring, but don't worry, I have something more interesting planned for the seventh snippet :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy_imIM4L-KYgw&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 7</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>/☃/☃8/☃

<p>This is an infinite loop. More interesting than the sixth snippet IMO.</p>

<p>When /// finds a <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>, it will keep replacing <code>pattern</code> with <code>replacement</code> until there are no more <code>pattern</code>s to be replaced. Therefore, if <code>replacement</code> contains <code>pattern</code>, it will always end up on an infinite loop.</p>

<p>There will always be a snowman to get replaced with a snowman and a badly drawn snowman:</p>

<p>Unary subtraction! Put the numbers in this order: <code>largest smallest</code>, like this: <a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=LzAgMC8gLzAwMDAwMDAgMDAwMDA&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><code>/0 0/ /0000000 00000</code></a></p>

<pre><code>/☃/\//\☃
</code></pre>

<p>Yay, 8 upvotes! An eight is the number that looks the most like a snowman.</p>

<p>The <code>/☃/\//</code> part replaces every snowman with a <code>/</code>. So you will probably think that if I place a snowman in the code, it'll print a <code>/</code>. Wrong.</p>

<p>Since <code>/</code>s are used for repeated string substitution, you'll have to put a <code>\</code> before the <code>/</code> (in this case, the <code>☃</code>) if you wanna print it.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious, but I forgot it once and spent some minutes trying to find the bug in my code.</p>

<pre><code>/☃/\\\\/☃
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>/☃/\\\\/</code> part replaces every snowman with two <code>\</code> (Since <code>\\</code> is only one <code>\</code>, <code>\\\\</code> is actually <code>\\</code>).</p>

<p>There's only one snowman after that, so it gets replaced by the two <code>\</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the two <code>\</code> turn into only one <code>\</code> and that gets printed.</p>

<pre><code>/☃/8/☃/8/B

<p>If you pay attention, the second replacement is incomplete. The first replacement replaces a snowman with an eight.</p>

<p>The second replacement doesn't do anything, since it's incomplete. Syntax errors don't exist in ///, so nothing happens. If you don't believe me, turn on debug on TIO.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy84Ly84L-KYgy_imIM&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 11</strong></a></p>

<p>I just realized today is 11/11, I'm adding snippet length 11 and this post has 11 upvotes...</p>

<p>I don't think there is anything important left to showcase about this language, /// is very simple. But I'll still try to add more snippets.</p>

<p>This is probably obvious, but replacements can modify other replacements.</p>

<p>The first replacement replaces every snowman with an eight:</p>

<pre><code>/8/☃/☃
/8/(☃)/(☃)
/8/8/8
</code></pre>

<p>This is an infinite loop (<code>/8/8/</code>), since there will always be an eight to be replaced.</p>

<pre><code>?&lt;!@&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the AND gate, from one of the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/83209/59806">16 Logic Gates answer by Martin Ender♦</a>. In his answer, the explanation was left for readers as practise. Well, maybe it's time for the solution:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3TpOP.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3TpOP.png" alt="and1"></a></p>

<p>First <code>?</code> reads the first input.  </p>

<p>If it is <code>0</code>, then the IP got reflected to NE direction at <code>&lt;</code> and directly wraps "to the left" (as it is <code>&lt;=0</code>) and got printed at <code>!</code>.  Whatever it reads at <code>?</code>, it wraps and stops at <code>@</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxZRs.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxZRs.png" alt="and2"></a></p>

<p>If it is <code>1</code>, the IP takes the right branch for the "conditional" and hit the "inclined mirror" side of <code>&lt;</code> and got reflected back and hit the "hub" side of <code>&lt;</code> which sends it to W direction to read another input. It then wraps and hit the "horizontal mirror" side of <code>&lt;</code> and gets itself to an implicit-if at the corner. <strong>6</strong> instructions made within this blue path.</p>

<p><em>The different usages of <code>&lt;</code> are all demostrated in this example</em>.</p>

<p>If the second input is <code>0</code>, then the IP goes along the red path above, which prints a <code>0</code> and reads the "third" input and stops.</p>

<p>If it is a <code>1</code> instead, yay we finally got 2 <code>1</code>s for the AND gate! The IP goes along the green path and prints out the <code>1</code> and terminates!</p>

<p>These 2 are simplified (thus not a very good version) of a <code>cat</code> program. For a real working one, please see <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62306">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>,;~
</code></pre>

<p>This reads and prints and also outputs a lot of trailing mysterious symbols.  What's happening?</p>

<p><code>,</code> reads a byte and <code>;</code> prints it no matter what <code>,</code> gets (If there is no input, <code>,</code> will return a <code>-1</code> and <code>;</code> will print it modulo 256 which is <code>255</code>).</p>

<p>Here is a trick which is useful in creating Hexagons: Using <code>~</code> (negation) to control the direction the IP goes before it reaches an <code>if</code> (no matter it is an implicit one or an explicit one like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> and some other conditionals).</p>

<p>If you find this hard to understand, then it's worth mentioning that this is <em>not</em> a linear loop.  As an exercise imagine the above are put into a 2-hexagon and you'll see why we need <code>~</code> to do make a loop with the implicit if :P The code basically runs in the same manner as in the length 2 snippet below!</p>

<p>Thus, when there is a byte, the memory will be positive and <code>~</code> makes it negative so it goes back to the top to read another byte.  Yet it won't stop...</p>

<p>So let's see the length 4 version of the <code>cat</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;,@;
</code></pre>

<p>When you <a href="http://hexagony.tryitonline.net/#code=PCxAOw&amp;input=SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try</a> this, it looks good.  Finally we have one program which stops!</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pqf6C.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pqf6C.png" alt="cat4"></a></p>

<p>It starts on the top left with an initial value of <code>0</code>. A trick here which is (again) quite common - deflect the initial IP with <code>&lt;</code>.  This is particularly useful when the main loop should end when the calculated value is <code>&lt;=0</code>.</p>

<p>Here it comes to the blue path. <code>;</code> prints the null byte (as it is initially <code>0</code>) and <code>,</code> reads a byte. An implicit-if decides if it should go to the green one (doing nothing and wraps back to the main blue loop for printing this byte) or it should go to the red terminal <code>@</code>.  </p>

<p>In some code golf challenges, it is acceptable to have null bytes printed before the desired output.  However this is not the case for the simple cat challenge attached above :P  Also, this does not handle null bytes <code>\0</code> well.  If you are curious how to do the <code>cat</code> with 6 bytes which handles <code>\0</code> and prints nothing else and stops, <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62306">check it out</a>! (The 6 bytes solution is shown after the 7 bytes)</p>

<p><em>This won't end.</em> Print all non-negative integers separated by <code>-</code>. </p>

<pre><code>!(
</code></pre>

<p>Not really. Indeed this is printing the unintialized edge as number (<code>0</code>), then decrement it and print again without a separator (<code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>, ...)</p>

<p>This is an illustration of both the Implicit Loop (wrapping) and Implicit If.</p>

<p>The IP starts at <code>!</code>, goes to the right to <code>(</code> and wraps to... not (directly to) <code>!</code> but somewhere else first. Because the code is used to fill in the smallest possible hexagon that can hold it:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7aK8B.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7aK8B.png" alt="showcase_2"></a></p>

<p>(Blue) For the existing code, after IP runs <code>(</code> (decrements) and the memory edge becomes <code>-1</code>, it wraps to the middle row and goes all its way to the corner.</p>

<p>And, as its value is <code>&lt;=0</code>, it goes to the left, which is the top row and we hit <code>!</code> again which prints <code>-1</code> and so on...</p>

<p>(Red) And if you change the source code to <code>!)</code>, it won't print <code>01234...</code>.  Because when it hits the corner, the memory edge is <code>&gt;0</code> and it turns to the right option (Pun not intended) which is the lower edge, and the lower edge wraps back to the middle - however all the ops are no-ops so the IP can never escape from the loop.</p>

<pre><code>:

<p>If you try it, it ends soon and nothing will happen. Well 1 byte snippet in Hexagony can't do much.</p>

<p><code>:</code> is the division in Hexagony and the result is rounded towards <code>-infty</code>.  </p>

<p>Why introduce this? Lemme introduce the Memory Model of this one.  <em>Without loss of generality</em> (it sounds good using Maths phrases), this is the initial Memory Pointer:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TurD2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TurD2.png" alt="memory_model"></a></p>

<p>Like Instruction Pointers which has an Op which it's currently on (a position) and a direction, the MP also has an edge (which holds a value) and a direction.</p>

<p>The edge on its left is its Left Neighbor (L) and that on right is the Right Neighbor (R).</p>

<p>Like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>%</code> (Modulo), <code>:</code> is also calculating <code>L (operation) R</code>.</p>

<p>One "interesting" thing about <code>:</code> and <code>%</code> is that when the Right Neighbor is <code>0</code> (the default value of an uninitialized edge), it silently errors out and hence terminating the program.  This behaviour sometimes saves bytes when the termination <code>@</code> is not used to stop the program.</p>

<p>I have read the answer here which is nice :P I also found some interesting snippets on this site thus I would like to try to get a chance to post them. <em>I love Hexagons!</em></p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>Hexagony, as its name suggests, gives programmers a painful experience (agony) playing with Hexagons, with its Instruction Pointers (IP) and Memory Pointers (MP).  Great thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Timwi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Timwi</a> who created <a href="https://github.com/Timwi/EsotericIDE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Esoteric IDE</a> for debugging Esoteric Languages and <a href="https://github.com/Timwi/HexagonyColorer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hexagony Colorer</a> which helps explaining the coupled IP paths.</p>

<p>When an IP goes out of the Hexagon, it wraps (Yup, implicitly looping) as if the Hexagon is used for tiling the ground. (Not exactly the case, because if you really wanna connect all wrapping paths, you would end up their edge overlapped like the graph on the right)
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rfmh8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rfmh8.png" alt="Wrapping"></a>
<code>c1234</code> wraps to <code>567890</code> wraps back to <code>c1234</code>...
<code>abcd</code> wraps to <code>efgh</code> and goes on... and we hit a corner.</p>

<p>For corner cases, there will be an Implicit-If, with <code>&lt;=0</code> is left and <code>&gt;0</code> is right. Say you (the instruction pointer when you are programming) go all the way <code>efgh.3.</code> to the corner. You are facing East.  You would either wrap to the top which is on your <em>left</em> and the bottom which is on your <em>right</em>.  If the MP is pointing to a memory edge which is <code>&lt;=0</code> you goes to the top, otherwise you goes to the bottom.</p>

<p>True beauty lies in making use of the implicit features and fitting different parts of the algorithm into Great Hexagonal Unity, with the use of mirrors (always like playing with scientific puzzle solving game).</p>

<div id="pu81" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/SuperJedi224/Golfical" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Golfical</a></h1>

<p>Golfical is a shiny, brand-new graphical programming language I made over the past few days, and published earlier today.</p>

<p>It uses a stack, a tape, and a register as memory. But primarily the tape.</p>

<p>The included encoder utility can be used to compress programs into a raw binary form, which can then be converted back to the original image or run directly by adding the <code>-x</code> flag. This requires from one to three bytes for each pixel, plus three bytes extra for encoding the dimensions (length and width are encoded as 
twelve bits each, just in case 8 isn't enough for some reason.)</p>

<p>Of course, the encoding is somewhat lossy, as all other colors that don't have instructions assigned to them are changed to white (both to save space and because the specs guarantee that no instruction will ever be assigned to white.)</p>

<p><strong>One pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9QBrC.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 200x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aOVGc.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>When the red channel is zero, Golfical interprets the green and blue channels as an integer literal and stores it in the target of the pointer. Thus, this stores the value 255*256+255=65535 into the target of the pointer. This is the largest number that can be stored directly in this way, though cells can be set in longer ways to values as large as 2<sup>31</sup>-1.</p>

<p>In the binary encoding generated by the included Encoder utility, this would represented by three bytes; the encoding includes an optimization that allows only two bytes to be used for this instruction when the green channel is zero.</p>

<p><strong>Two pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dRVeV.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 160x with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7O7uI.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>(10,0,0) inputs a number and (10,1,1) outputs it as a character. In the compressed binary encoding, these two instructions add one byte each.</p>

<p><strong>Three pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u4id2.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 160x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GOyNd.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>(10,0,1) is like (10,0,0), except it reads a character instead of a number. (12,0,0) pushes the target of the pointer to the stack. (The binary encoding represents these instructions as 1 byte each.)</p>

<p>Therefore, this snippet reads a character, pushes it to the stack, and then reads another character.</p>

<p><strong>Four pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OiXDt.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 125x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ydtv.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Simulates the rolling of a d100. The two new instructions here are 02xxxx (which works like 00xxxx but as an increment instead of an assignment) and 0D0001 (13,0,1) which sets the target of the pointer to a random integer between 0, inclusive, and its previous value, exclusive. Like 00xxxx, 02xxxx is represented in the encoding using two bytes if the green channel is zero or three otherwise. 0D0001 is represented as one byte.</p>

<p><strong>Five pixel example:</strong></p>

<p>It took me a while to decide what to do with this one, but eventually I decided to go with this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pQmvX.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 125x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jBpSq.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>(11,0,0) through (11,0,3) are absolute turn instructions (relative turn instructions, as well as many of the conditional relative turns, are later in the 11 block). (11,0,1) is East and (11,0,3) is West.</p>

<p>This program prints <code>lolololololololololololololololololo</code> ad infininum.</p>

<p><strong>Six Pixel Example</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k9hJ9.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 200x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G78T5.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>An infinite counter (limited, of course, by the 32-bit two's complement integer range; a proper infinite counter would be much harder to implement.) Also our first properly 2-dimensional example here.</p>

<p><strong>Eight pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g9SX0.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Magnified 100x with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vHHUI.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A primality tester using the language's prime testing builtin (14,3,0), which makes a relative right turn if and only if the target of the pointer is prime. The official encoder program encodes this program in 13 bytes.</p>

<pre><code>[1, 2].each{|i|p i}
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby supports <code>for</code> loops, but the <code>.each</code> method is preferred. The code in brackets is a <strong>block</strong>, essentially a single-use anonymous function. Blocks can take parameters, which are enclosed in pipe characters. The <code>p</code> is a shortcut for <code>puts [something].inspect</code>. The <code>.inspect</code> method is a variation of <code>.to_s</code> which provides more details about the object.  </p>

<p><strong>Length 18</strong></p>

<pre><code>%i[I love you too]
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create an array of symbols, the result would be: <code>[:I, :love, :you, :too]</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>

<pre><code>'1.34'[/(\.\d+)/]
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on creating snippet then parse it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expression</a>. This regular expression means get any dot <code>\.</code> that followed by one or more (<code>+</code>) digit (<code>\d</code>) then capture it. The result of this snippet is a new string containing <code>.34</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 16</strong></p>

<pre><code>'abcdefg'[3..-1]
</code></pre>

<p>This statement means, create a string containing <code>abcdefg</code>, then get the fourth (4th = <code>3</code>) character until the end (last = <code>-1</code>). Another example: <code>[3..3]</code> get the fourth character only (<code>d</code>), <code>[3..5]</code> get the fourth until sixth characters (<code>def</code>), <code>[-3..-1]</code> get the third last character until the last character (<code>efg</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Length 15</strong></p>

<pre><code>%w{i love you!}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a shortcut to create array of words (<code>string</code>), that is equal to <code>['i', 'love', 'you!']</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 14</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3,4]*'ab'
</code></pre>

<p>Array multiplication with a string equals to call a <code>.join</code> method, the result of this snippet is <code>1ab2ab3ab4</code>, that also equal to calling: <code>[1,2,3,4].join 'ab'</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 13</strong></p>

<pre><code>y=-&gt;x{x**3}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a <a href="http://pragdave.me/blog/2008/05/22/new-lambda-syntax-in-ruby-19/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>lambda</code></a> (or sometimes called anonymous function) using stab operator <code>-&gt;</code>. This statement means create an anonymous function that accept one parameter <code>x</code> that returns <code>x*x*x</code>, then assign this function to a variable named <code>y</code>. Any <code>lambda</code> can be called using <code>.call</code> method, for example:</p>

<pre><code>y = -&gt;(x){x**3}
y.call 8 # 512
</code></pre>

<p>This is equal to:</p>

<pre><code>y = lambda {|x| x**3}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 12</strong> (by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/21164/devon-parsons">Devon Parsons</a>)</p>

<pre><code>puts "#{$$}"
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet shows a couple things. As shown below, <code>puts</code> writes to <code>STDOUT</code>. Code encapsulated in <code>#{ code_here }</code> is evaluated when the string is created, provided the string is made with double quotes. And ruby stores a bunch of useful global variables in double-character shorthand: For example, <code>$~</code> is the most recent regex match, and in this snippet, <code>$$</code> is the current process ID. So this snippet writes the current process' ID to <code>STDOUT</code>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the ID is of type <code>Fixnum</code>. The string interpolation automatically calls the <code>to_s</code> method on the evaluated code, and <code>to_s</code> by convention returns a string interpretation of the object.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>

<pre><code>x={a:1,b:2}
</code></pre>

<p>The statement above is one (of many way to create a <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hash</a> or commonly called associative array), to access the value, you can type <code>x[:a]</code>, where <code>:a</code> is a symbol (explained in <strong>Length 2</strong>). To set a value you can type <code>x[:key_name] = 'yayy'</code>. The key of a Hash could be anything not just symbol. Another popular way to create a Hash is using <code>=&gt;</code> symbol, for example:</p>

<pre><code>x = { 'a' =&gt; 123, 456 =&gt; [7,8,9], c: 'wow' }
# x['a'] == 123
# x[456] == [7,8,9]
# x[:c] == 'wow'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre><code>[*(8..11)]
</code></pre>

<p>In this snippet, that statement has the same effect as typing: <code>[8,9,10,11]</code>. The <code>8..11</code> part is called <code>Range</code> object. The <code>*</code> operator is the splat operator, in this part, the operator has the same effect as <code>.to_a</code> to array conversion <code>(8..11).to_a</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>def x;end
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a function, that example is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>def x
end
</code></pre>

<p>To fill the function content, you may type it before the <code>end</code> keyword, for example:</p>

<pre><code>def x
  puts 'the x function has been called'
  123
end
</code></pre>

<p>Anything that typed before <code>end</code> keyword would be returned, so in this statement <code>y = x</code>, the <code>y</code> variable would contain <code>123</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>

<pre><code>9.to_s(2)
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to perform base conversion from base-10 integer to binary number, the result would be <code>1001</code>. You can change number <code>2</code> into another base, and <code>.to_i</code> can have parameters too, to parse from <code>string</code> to number, for example <code>'1101'.to_i(2)</code> that would return <code>13</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>__END__
</code></pre>

<p><code>__END__</code> is a line keyword that denotes the end of regular source code, the lines below that line wont be executed and would be gathered in <code>DATA</code> string constant.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>rescue
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rescue</code> keyword is Ruby's keyword to catch raised exception, we could use this as one-line, for example: <code>x = 1/0 rescue 2</code>, that would set <code>x</code> into <code>2</code>, or we could use it within <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> keyword, for example:</p>

<pre><code>begin
  1/0
rescue ZeroDivisionError
  puts 'zero division detected
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can find more information about ZeroDivisionError <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/ZeroDivisionError.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
</code></pre>

<p><code>BEGIN</code> is a keyword that will execute following code-block before anything else withint the script, for example <code>puts 'b'; BEGIN { puts 'a' }</code> would give an output: <code>a</code> then <code>b</code>. There are also <code>END</code> keyword that executes next code-block before program termination.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>puts
</code></pre>

<p>This function would print a newline on the console, if you add anything as parameter for example: <code>puts('A')</code> or <code>puts 'A'</code>, this would print an <code>A</code> character then a newline.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>

<pre><code>'A'
</code></pre>

<p>Single quote is one way to create a string, there are another way such as double quote, always use single quote for better performance when no <a href="http://rors.org/2008/10/26/dont-escape-in-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interpolation</a> needed. To get the code-point value of a single string, use <code>.ord</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>:x
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a symbol. Symbol starts with colon followed by quoted string, underscore or alphabet. <a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/codecorn/ruby/symbols.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Symbol</a> is an object to hold immutable string, that normally used as hash's key.

<p>This is an example on how you make a <code>Fixnum</code> object, fixed number is an integer. everything is an object in Ruby, they could have methods such as: <code>1.to_f</code> would return <code>1.0</code> a <code>Float</code> object, or <code>1.to_s</code> would return <code>"1"</code> a <code>String</code> object.</p>

<h1>Length 4:</h1>

<pre><code>(_;)

<p>Prints <code>0</code> forever.  The <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> denote the start and end of a infinite loop, and the <code>_;</code> pops from the empty stack (giving <code>0</code>) and prints.</p>

<p>Alternate:</p>

<pre><code>_UNK

<h1>Length 5:</h1>

<pre><code>^{i}:
</code></pre>

<p>Prints a list with the input if it is truthy, or another truthy value of the same type as the input.  e.g. <code>1</code> -> <code>[1]</code>, <code>0</code> -> <code>[1]</code>, <code>asd</code> -> <code>[u'asd']</code>.  </p>

<p>Note: The <code>u</code> is due to unicode formatting.</p>

<p>Alternate:</p>

<pre><code>^^s=i
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs <code>True</code> if the 2 inputs are equal, else <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>Alternate #2:</p>

<pre><code>^s^$:
</code></pre>

<p>Prints inclusive range of the 2 inputs, so <code>2, 4</code> gives <code>[2, 3, 4]</code></p>

<h1>Length 7</h1>

<pre><code>^X({@})
</code></pre>

<p>This is a truth machine.  The <code>^</code> gets input, the <code>X</code> prints the ToS without popping (equivalent to <code>o;</code>), and the <code>({@})</code> ends the program if the ToS is <code>0</code>.  </p>

<p>Alternate:</p>

<pre><code>#--repl
</code></pre>

<p>This starts the REPL, which is like a infinite prompt for code.  But the stack is persistent, and implicit output always applies.</p>

<hr>

<p>At this point in time, many changes were made to Fuzzy Octo Guacamole, including a REPL, implicit output and the <code>X</code> command.  </p>

<p>The older snippets are staying the same, but I am adding a new alternative snippet for each length.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Length 8:</h1>

<pre><code>$--!++[*]
</code></pre>

<p>This works either as a function (add a <code>^</code> before), or in the REPL. (type the number, hit enter, paste this, hit enter).</p>

<h1>Length 9:</h1>

<pre><code>2pP*.2P**

<p><code>2</code> pushes 2 to the stack, then <code>2^</code> pushes 2 and gets input and <code>p</code> raises it to the 2nd power (because of that 2 we pushed).  </p>

<p>The same is done again with the <code>2^p</code>. </p>

<p>Then we subtract the squared numbers we got, and square them (using that first <code>2</code> we pushed at the beginning). Finally, <code>X</code> peeks and pops.</p>

<p>Oasis is a language made by Adnan specialized in number sequences.</p>

<p>You can try it online <a href="http://oasis.tryitonline.net/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>n
</code></pre>

<p>Not very interesting, just push <code>n</code> (The current argument) and print it because implicit output.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>n1
</code></pre>

<p>Same as the previous snippet, but give <code>1</code> for the argument <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Oasis programs can have a list of hardcoded definitions for special cases.</p>

<p>So <code>n1</code> can be described in pseudocode as:</p>

<pre><code>A(n) = n
A(0) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Special cases and indexes are reversed, so to make</p>

<pre><code>A(0) = 1
A(1) = 4
</code></pre>

<p>The correct special cases definition is <code>41</code></p>

<p>As @Adnan pointed it out, another interesting snippet is the fibonnaci sequence:</p>

<pre><code>+T
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>T</code> is replaced with <code>10</code>, so this is expanded to</p>

<pre><code>+10
</code></pre>

<p>Which mean</p>

<pre><code>A(n) = A(n - 1) + A(n - 2)
A(0) = 0
A(1) = 1
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<div id="pu86" class="pu"><h1>Microscript</h1>

<p>Microscript is a <s>new expiremental</s> golfing language I've been working on <s>recently</s>. For my <em>Death By Shock Probe</em> challenge, I was able to write a program that would have beaten out the leading Pyth entry by one byte, except for the fact that the language is too new to be eligible to actually compete in that challenge.</p>

<p>It uses a pair of stacks to manipulate data, and currently has just over 30 distinct commands</p>

<p>The esolangs wiki article can be found <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Microscript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Length 0 snippet:</strong></p>

<p>The empty program prints 0, followed by a newline. This is because the main register is initially 0, and printing is implicit unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong> <code>p</code></p>

<p>Prints the contents of the register to the output, followed by a newline. On end of execution, this will be done automatically, unless execution was halted by the <code>h</code> command.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet:</strong> <code>99</code></p>

<p>Any positive integer literal not part of another command will increment the main register by that value. Thus, unless part of another command, this will add 99 to the value in said register.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong> <code>is*</code></p>

<p>Currently the shortest example program on the esolangs wiki article. Takes in an input and squares it. <code>i</code> takes a number from the input and writes it to the register, <code>s</code> pushes it to the stack (unlike in HSPAL, this does not zero the register), and <code>*</code> pops it off the stack again and multiplies it by the value in the register, writing the result to the register. Then, as mentioned above, the new value is printed implicitly.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong> <code>isi+</code></p>

<p>Another example program from the esolangs wiki article. Takes two inputs and outputs their sum.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong> <code>'~Pph</code></p>

<p><code>'&lt;any character&gt;</code> is the language's equivalent of a character literal. <code>P</code> prints as a character while <code>p</code> prints as an integer. Finally, <code>h</code> halts immediately without the implicit printing. Therefore, the output from this is <code>~126</code>. This is technically equivalent to the shorter (3 byte) <code>'~P</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 Snippet:</strong> <code>i{z1p}</code></p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Truth-machine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">truth machine</a> which converts values not in {0,1} to 1. The closing bracket is optional in this case, but I already had a length 5 snippet. <code>{}</code> is the equivelent of BrainF***'s <code>[]</code>; Microscript uses square brackets for other purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 Snippet:</strong> <code>20ec1r4</code></p>

<p>Simulates the rolling of 1,048,576 four-sided dice. This is what would have been the winning entry for my afformentioned <em>Death By Shock Probe</em> challenge had Microscript come out a short time earlier. The <code>c</code> command was the language's first form of iteration- essentially "zero the register, then repeat the following a number of times equalling the value that was in the register before it was zeroed". <code>1</code> increments by 1, and <code>r4</code> increments by a random integer on [0,4). Lastly, <code>e</code> is a base-2 exponential function while <code>E</code> is the base-10 equivalent. Thus, <code>10Ec1r4</code> (or, equivalently, <code>1EEc1r4</code>) would simulate the rolling of <em>ten billion</em> four-sided dice. Eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong> <code>1{I[h]fan</code></p>

<p>A <code>cat</code> program that terminates on the first empty line (as the language currently lacks EOF detection)</p>

<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong> <code>0"Caxq"Caxq</code></p>

<p><strong>hansl</strong> is a programming language that is used in the statistical software project <a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">gretl</a> since 2001. It resembles a mixture of R, Stata, and C. It operates with datasets, time series, vectors, matrices, and functions. Just as in R, there are dozens of user-written packages for econometrics and data analysis. It is a matrix-oriented interpreted language that is Turing-complete (!). Its fortes are econometric estimation and numerical maximisation, and it can be integrated with R, Ox, Octave, Stata, Python, Julia, and gnuplot.</p>

Do you have two matrices you want to assemble? <code>X~Y</code>, easy as pie.</p>

<pre><code>a
</code></pre>

<p>Pip's default method of getting input is by command-line arguments (hereinafter "cmdline args"). The first five args are assigned to the variables <code>a</code> through <code>e</code>, and the whole list is assigned to <code>g</code>.</p>

<p>Since it is at the end of the program, the expression <code>a</code> is auto-printed. So this program outputs the first cmdline arg.</p>

<pre><code>/q
</code></pre>

<p>To get input from stdin, use the <code>q</code> special variable. Every time it is referenced, it reads a line of input.</p>

<p>Many operators have both binary and unary versions. This is expected behavior for operators like <code>-</code>, and makes good sense for others like <code>^</code> split and <code>J</code> join. Here we have a somewhat unusual example: unary <code>/</code> inverts its argument. Inputting <code>4</code> will give <code>0.25</code> as output, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This snippet also demonstrates a feature that Pip shares with Perl and PHP: numbers are strings and strings are numbers. Both are represented by a data type called Scalar. Upshot: you don't have to convert <code>q</code>'s line of input to a number before doing math with it.</p>

<p>But what happens if you input something that's not a number, like <code>Hello world</code>? In a numeric context, it's treated as <code>0</code>. Dividing by <code>0</code>, like most error conditions, returns the special <em>nil</em> value, which produces no output when printed. If you want to see what went wrong, you can use the <code>-w</code> flag to enable warnings, in which case Pip will tell you:</p>

<pre><code>^g

<p>As mentioned above, <code>g</code> is a list of all cmdline ar<strong>g</strong>s. Many operators work itemwise on lists, and <code>^</code> (split) is one of them. This code splits the items of <code>g</code> into lists of characters.</p>

<p>If you ran this 2-byte code without the flag, it wouldn't be obvious what the program did, because Pip's default way of outputting lists is to concatenate the items together. To demonstrate that the split operation worked, we need to change the output format. About half of Pip's <a href="https://github.com/dloscutoff/pip/blob/master/Documentation/Command-line%20flags.md" rel="nofollow">command-line flags</a> have to do with list formatting. The <code>-p</code> flag applies <code>RP</code> (analogous to Python's <code>repr</code>) to the list before outputting it, making it easy to see the structure:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; python pip.py -pe "^g" 42 Hello
[[4;2];["H";"e";"l";"l";"o"]]
</code></pre>

<p>Use the TIO link above to play around with the other list flags (<code>-s</code>, <code>-n</code>, <code>-l</code>, <code>-P</code>, <code>-S</code>) and see how the output changes.</p>

<p>The <code>@&lt;</code> "left-of" operator returns a slice from the left end of an iterable (scalar, list, or range). It's equivalent to Python <code>iterable[:index]</code>--<em>except</em> that the Pip version works even when the index is greater than the length of the iterable. In that case it repeats the iterable until it's longer than the index, then takes the slice (like <code>take</code> + <code>cycle</code> in Haskell). So <code>z@&lt;h</code> gives the first 100 characters of the lowercase alphabet:</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Brachylog is a declarative logic programming language based on Prolog. Its name is constituted of the prefix <em>brachy-</em> (meaning <em>short</em>, from ancient greek <em>βραχύς</em>) and the suffix <em>-log</em>, to mark its link to Prolog.</p>
<h3>Length 1</h3>
<pre><code>r
</code></pre>
<p>A seemingly simple program, that is useful to understand some fundamental basics about Brachylog (and declarative programming in general): Reverse something.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, the program <code>r</code> is a main predicate consisting of one rule (namely, <code>r</code>). All rules in Brachylog implicitely start with the Input (noted <code>?</code>) and end with the Output (noted <code>.</code>).</p>
<p>Therefore, our program is really <code>?r.</code>, which can be read as <em>Output is the reverse of the Input</em>. The built-in <code>r - Reverse</code> works on the three main data types of Brachylog: <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=WzE6InRlc3QiOjI6IlBQQ0ciXQ&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lists</a>, <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strings</a> and <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=MTIzNDU&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integers</a>.</p>
<p>But more interestingly, it is a <em>relationship</em> that we state with <code>r</code>, not a one-way function like most programming languages. As such, <code>r</code> also works as expected <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=Wg&amp;args=WzE6InRlc3QiOjI6IlBQQ0ciXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">when the Output is ground and the Input is not!</a> It even works if both the input and the output have no value, though that doesn't show well on the online interpreter and with a program limited to one character.</p>
<p>We will continues to see in the next examples that predicates in Brachylog are relationships between variables and are as such much more expressive than traditional imperative function. We can also note that the Input and Output of predicates are merely called that because that's usually how those variables are used, but those are simply names and they don't mean that for example the Input necessarily has to be a ground variable.</p>
<h3>Length 2</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cj8&amp;input=MTIzNDU0MzIx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>r?</pre></a></p>
<p>Now that we know that <code>r</code> is <em>reverse</em>, and that <code>?</code> is the Input, you can probably guess what this program does: test whether the input is a palindrome or not.</p>
<p>Indeed, <code>r?</code> is really <code>?r?.</code>, which can be read as: <em>Input is the reverse of the Input, and Output is the same as the Input</em>. Since we do not need the Output at all here, the second part of the sentence can be disregarded and we then see that it is indeed a palindromeness checking program.</p>
<p>The program <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=LnI&amp;input=&amp;args=MTIzNDU0MzIx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.r</code></a> would have worked the same if we passed our input through the Output variable.</p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>

<p>As you can see from the TIO link, the code above squares each element of the input. <code>^</code> being the squaring built-in predicate, and <code>a</code> being <em>Apply</em>, a <em>meta-predicate</em>.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, all predicates have only an input and an output argument. Therefore, when we need to &quot;pass&quot; more than one thing to the predicate, we put them in a list.</p>
<p>This is what we are doing with <code>:</code>, which is also the list separator. By writing <code>:^</code>, we are constructing the list <code>[Input, brachylog_power]</code>. So, just like numbers, strings and lists, we can also put <em>predicates</em> in lists.</p>
<p><em>Apply</em> takes the last element of its input argument as being a predicate, and queries that predicate each time with an element of the rest of its input argument as input (hence why it is called a meta-predicate). The output of <em>apply</em> accumulates the outputs of the queries. This predicate is usually called <code>map</code> in other languages (<code>maplist</code> in Prolog).</p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OkBbZg&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>:@[f</pre></a></p>
<p>Continuing on meta-predicates, here is <code>f</code>: <em>Findall</em>. As its name suggests, this will find all valid outputs of a predicate for a specific input.</p>
<p>Here, the input to <em>Findall</em> is the list <code>[Input, brachylog_string_prefix]</code>. The predicate <em>string_prefix</em> <code>@[</code> is true if its output is a prefix of the input. By running <em>Findall</em> on it, we will obtain all prefixes of <code>?</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>string</em> in <em>string_prefix</em> only comes from the fact that it is a 2 symbols predicate which starts with <code>@</code> (which represent operations that are more often done on strings). This predicate of course doesn't only work on strings, but also on integers and lists.</p>
<h3>Length 5</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OkxjLnI&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>:Lc.r</pre></a></p>
<p>This is probably my favorite Brachylog program (most likely because <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/77095/palindromizing-the-strings">it is twice as short as the Jelly answer on this challenge!</a>). This is a program which palindromizes its input.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, strings and integers can contain variable characters/digits, just like how lists can contain variables as elements. Therefore, <code>:Lc.</code> means <em>“Output is the result of concatenating the Input and a variable <code>L</code>”</em>. Then, we impose with <code>.r</code> that the output reversed is still the output (thus, that the output is a palindrome). This will force Brachylog to <strong>unify</strong> the variable values of <code>L</code> so that the output is indeed a palindrome.</p>
<h3>Length 6</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OjFmCn5j&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>:1f
~c
</pre></a></p>
<p>Here is another example of the use of <code>f - Findall</code> and <code>c - Concatenate</code>.</p>
<p>The first line is the main predicate and states <em>“Find all valid outputs of predicate 1 given the Input as input”</em>. The second line is predicate 1 and states <code>The output, when concatenated, results in the Input</code>.</p>
<p>Here, <code>~</code> is a simple control symbol which &quot;flips&quot; the arguments of the following predicate: <code>AcZ</code> means “<code>Z</code> is the result of concatenating the elements of <code>A</code>” whereas <code>A~cZ</code> means “concatenating the elements of <code>Z</code> results in <code>A</code>”.</p>
<p>Therefore the program above will find all possible lists of strings (excluding the ones containing the empty string), which when concatenated will result in the input.</p>
<p>Note that <code>~c</code> is not a second built-in which does the reverse of <code>c</code> ; it <strong>is</strong> the same as <code>c</code>, but called with swapped arguments. To convince you of this, <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OjFmCiwuYz8s&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rewriting predicate 1 as <code>,.c?,</code> will result in the same program</a>.</p>
<p>Side note: this program could have been written <code>:{~c}f</code>, which does the exact same thing. Choosing one or the other is mostly a matter of preference.</p>
<h3>Length 7</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OjF5CiNwPQ&amp;input=MTAw&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>:1y
#p=</pre></a></p>
<p>This demonstrates another meta-predicate: <code>y - Yield</code>, and a major feature of Brachylog: constraints-based arithmetic.</p>
<p><code>y - Yield</code> is a meta predicate very similar to <code>f - Findall</code>, the difference between the two being that <code>y</code> will unify its output with the first <code>N</code> outputs of the queried predicate (<code>N</code> being the penultimate element of the input arguments), instead of all of the outputs. This is thus very useful for predicates that have an infinite number of choice points, such as arithmetic series.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, all integer arithmetic is based on <strong>constraints</strong>. This makes operations on integers very declarative in nature ; if we declare the relationship that <code>X + Y = Z</code> (which in Brachylog would be written as <code>X:Y+Z</code>), then this constraint will hold even if those variables have no ground value. Adding more and more constraints will keep on reducing the search space for the possible values of those variables. Then, the labeling process (using <code>=</code> in Brachylog) will assign values to variables such that they respect all constraints that were applied to them.</p>
<p><code>#p - constraint_prime</code> is a predicate which constrains its input <code>?</code> (which is unified with its output <code>.</code>) such that it must be a prime number. Using <code>= - Equals</code>, we can then label that variable so that it takes a ground value. The labeling process will order choice points according to the magnitude of the values, which is why overall this program yields the first <code>N</code> prime numbers, starting from <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, this does exactly the same thing as the previous 7 bytes program. This one though is much more easier to describe and understand.</p>
<p>We use <code>~l</code> to get a list whose length is the Input. We then impose with <code>&lt;</code> that the list must contain integers and must be strictly increasing. Using <code>Apply</code>, <code>:#pa</code> then constrains each integer of the list to be a prime number. We then use <code>=</code> to label the values of that list, which results in a strictly increasing list of prime numbers.</p>

<p>Just like in Prolog, we can write multiple rules for a single predicate, using <code>|</code>: the first rule <code>#0</code> constrains the Input = the Ouput to be a single digit. If this is not possible, the second rule <code>@e+:0&amp;</code> will split the input as a list of digits, then sum them and call Predicate 0 (the main predicate) recursively.</p>

<h2>0-vote</h2>

<p>eacal is a language made by me in 2016. It's very extremely verbose, but, as I hope, is capable. There is one command per line, and each data entry is separated by spaces. It is meant to be classified under a lot of programming paradigms, which includes right now, imperative, structured, stack-based, object oriented, event-driven, and a tad of functional.</p>

<p>Fun fact: the empty program errors.</p>

<h2>1-vote</h2>

<pre><code>v
</code></pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>eacal is currently running.
</code></pre>

<p>This tells you if eacal is still alive. Helpful!</p>

<h2>2-vote</h2>

<pre><code>on
</code></pre>

<p>This is the event-driven portion of eacal. It's syntax is:</p>

<pre><code>on &lt;event&gt; &lt;code evaluating to a function&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>on end eval print string Done!

print string Running...
</code></pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>Running...
Done!
</code></pre>

<h2>3-vote</h2>

<pre><code>arg
</code></pre>

<p>This returns all of the command-line arguments passed to the program. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>node eacal.js &lt;file&gt; 3 4 Hello
</code></pre>

<p>File:</p>

<pre><code>print arg
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>[ '3', '4', 'Hello' ]
</code></pre>

<h2>4-vote</h2>

<pre><code>init
</code></pre>

<p>This is used to initialize stacks, like so:</p>

<pre><code>init main
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the stack does not exist.</p>

<h2>5-vote</h2>

<pre><code>alias
</code></pre>

<p>This sets creates a command that function the same as another command. Example:</p>

<pre><code>alias define_stack init
define_stack main
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>

<pre><code>init main
</code></pre>

<p>This is very helpful in golfing.</p>

<h2>6-vote</h2>

<pre><code>string
</code></pre>

<p>Represents a string, where it's arguments are joined by spaces. So, <code>Hello, World!</code> is this:</p>

<pre><code>string Hello, World!
</code></pre>

<h2>7-vote</h2>

<pre><code>numlist
</code></pre>

<p>This returns an array of numbers representative of its arguments. For the first few Fibonacci numbers in a list:</p>

<pre><code>numlist 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
</code></pre>

<h2>8-vote</h2>

<pre><code>func add
</code></pre>

<p>This shows some of eacal's function programming. You can execute it on a stack named <code>k</code> using <code>exec k--func add</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>init main
push main number 5
push main number 8
print exec main--func add
; outputs 13
</code></pre>

<p>I will be focusing on features/snippets of/from ES6 standard in this answer. Some snippets require knowledge of topics previously presented, so you may want to read this bottom-to-top.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>&quot;𠮷&quot;.codePointAt()
</code></pre>
<p>More Unicode support! <code>.codePointAt()</code> is a Unicode-compliant version of <code>.charCodeAt()</code>. For example, if you were to take</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>&quot;𠮷&quot;.charCodeAt()
</code></pre>
<p>you would find <code>55362</code>. This might seem right, but if you convert it to hexadecimal, you would find that it corresponds to U+D842. Looking on <a href="http://graphemica.com" rel="noreferrer">Graphemica</a>, we can see that the character is actually <a href="http://graphemica.com/%F0%A0%AE%B7" rel="noreferrer">U+20BB7</a>. U+D842 is one of the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U.2B10000_to_U.2B10FFFF" rel="noreferrer">surrogates</a> that makes up the UTF-16 representation of that character.</p>
<p>But enough of these details: the point of <code>.codePointAt()</code> is to find the actual Unicode point of the character. <code>&quot;𠮷&quot;.codePointAt()</code> is <code>134071</code>, or U+20BB7—the correct result. Finally Unicode lovers can use JavaScript!</p>
<p><strong>Length 16 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>/^.$/u.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Another nice feature of ES6 is proper Unicode support! If you tried this code in ES5:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>alert(/^.$/.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>You might be surprised to find that the answer is <code>false</code>! The problem here is in JavaScript's default encoding, UTF-16: characters above U+FFFF are actually represented as 2 chars, called &quot;surrogates&quot;. (You can learn more about this on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U.2B10000_to_U.2B10FFFF" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.) In order to fix this, you need a more complex regex:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>alert(/^(?:[\uD800-\uDBFF][\uDC00-\uDFFF]|.)$/.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>ES6 introduces the <code>u</code> flag on regexes. When <code>u</code> is set, characters above U+FFFF are still captured as a single char. So <code>/^.$/u.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;)</code> returns the correct result: <code>true</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>String.raw`q\n`
</code></pre>
<p>Back to tagged templates! ES6 comes with a function all set up to be used as a tag: <code>String.raw</code>. This returns the raw text you typed in the template (replacing interpolations with their values), so the above snippet is equalivalent to <code>&quot;q\\n&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 14 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Number.EPSILON
</code></pre>
<p>As you may know, JavaScript's numbers are not arbitrary-precision; they have exactly 53 bits of precision. This can cause problems when trying to add decimal numbers:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var point3 = 0.1 + 0.2;
alert(point3 === 0.3); // false!
</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is that neither <code>0.1</code> nor <code>0.2</code> can be represented exactly in binary, and when adding them together, the least significant bit is rounded the wrong way, resulting in <code>0.30000000000000004</code> instead of <code>0.3</code>.</p>
<p><code>Number.EPSILON</code> was added as a workaround to this problem; it is equal to 2<sup>-53</sup>, the smallest number that can be added to 1 without rounding back down to 1. We can use this to create a new equals function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>equals = (num1, num2) =&gt; Math.abs(num1 - num2) &lt; Number.EPSILON;

alert(equals(point3, 0.3)); // true!
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray for ES6!</p>
<p><strong>Length 13 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>s=&gt;s.split` `
</code></pre>
<p>What is this? A function call without parentheses? Actually, it's another use of template literals: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals" rel="noreferrer">tagged templates</a>! But what is actually happening here?</p>
<p>When you tag a template with a function, it calls the function as usual, but it passes in the arguments a little differently. Take this example function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function parseMe(strings, name, age) {
  alert(`Your name is ${ name } and you are ${ age } years old`);
  console.log(&quot;We don't need these strings:&quot;, strings);
}

myName = &quot;Bob&quot;;
myAge = 123;
parseMe `Hello, I'm ${ myName } and I've orbited the earth ${ myAge } times.`;
</code></pre>
<p>This alerts <code>Your name is Bob and you are 123 years old</code>. Why? When calling a function with a tagged template, JavaScript passes each <code>${ }</code> value as a separate parameter, groups the strings into an array which is passed before everything else. So you're really calling <code>parseMe</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>parseMe( [&quot;Hello, I'm &quot;, &quot; and I've orbited the earth &quot;, &quot;times.&quot;], myName, myAge );
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, right? Now back to the original snippet. Now we can see that it could be written like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>s=&gt;s.split([&quot; &quot;])
</code></pre>
<p><code>.split</code> coerces its argument to a string before splitting. The string representation of <code>[&quot; &quot;]</code> is <code>&quot; &quot;</code>, so the function could be written yet another way:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>s=&gt;s.split(&quot; &quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And this simply splits the text on spaces, which splits it into words. Isn't ES6 awesome?</p>
<p><strong>Length 12 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>n=&gt;`Hi
${n}`
</code></pre>
<p>Introducing...template literals! Yet another super-helpful ES6 feature. These act like strings for the most part, but you can include newlines without escaping them. Not only that, but you can also use interpolation! If you run the above function with input <code>&quot;JavaScript&quot;</code>, it will output this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Hi
JavaScript
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 11 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[a,b]=[b,a]
</code></pre>
<p>Tired of using that old <code>var tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;</code> trick to swap variables? Now you don't have to! Using destructuring, you can swap those two variables quickly and concisely with the above statement.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[a,...b]=b
</code></pre>
<p>Destructuring! Yay! This is one of the cooler features of ES6. You can use it to do many things that would have taken a lot more bytes in ES5. For example, this is what the above statement corresponds to in ES5:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>a=b[0],b=b.slice(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, <code>a=b.unshift()</code> works too, but consider when you want to grab the first three items:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[x,y,z,...b]=b
x=b.unshift(),y=b.unshift(),z=b.unshift()
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you don't want to change the value of <code>b</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[x,y,z]=b
x=b[0],y=b[1],z=b[2]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, destructuring is shorter, more readable, and just all-around better.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>new Set()
</code></pre>
<p>Another useful data-type that JavaScript now supports is Sets! You can create a set like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var myArray = [1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 1];
var mySet = new Set(myArray);
// Set [ 1, 3, 6, 2 ]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, creating a Set out of an array removes all duplicate items. You can turn it back into an array with the spread operator:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>myArray = [...mySet];
// [ 1, 3, 6, 2 ]
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this trick on strings:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var myString = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
var mySet = new Set(myString);
myString = [...mySet].join(&quot;&quot;);
// &quot;Helo, Wrd!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that the Set constructor must be called with <code>new</code>, and only works on the first argument. For example, this won't work:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var mySet = new Set(1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 1);
// TypeError: 1 is not iterable
</code></pre>
<p>You can learn all about Sets on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" rel="noreferrer">this page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>(i=0)=&gt;i
</code></pre>
<p>You probably understand what this example is: default parameters! JavaScript ES5 is really horrible with default values. Usually you can get away with this workaround:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function f(i) {
  i = i || 0;
  return i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this resets <code>i</code> if it is <em>anything</em> falsy (<code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>null</code>, or <code>undefined</code>). To just do <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, you have to be much more verbose:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function f(i) {
  if (typeof i === &quot;undefined&quot; || i === null)
    i = 0;
  return i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>But ES6 contains a new syntax for default values! Now you can shorten your code to this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function f(i = 0) {
  return i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or in ES6 arrow notation, <code>f=(i=0)=&gt;i</code>. When given an input, this just returns the input, but when called with no input, it returns <code>0</code>. This is very helpful in uncountable scenarios, and possibly one of the best additions of ES6.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Symbol
</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript now supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol" rel="noreferrer">Symbols</a>! A symbol is created with <code>Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>, and every symbol created is different: <code>Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;) !== Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;)</code> The only way to keep a symbol is to assign it to a variable: <code>var sym = Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;); sym === sym</code></p>
<p>One of the most useful Symbols is <code>Symbol.iterator</code>. This is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator" rel="noreferrer">Generator</a> which is used whenever you iterate over an object, whether with for-in loops or the <code>...</code> operator (see below). For example, the following code defines an iterator for all Number objects:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Number.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function* () {
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; this; i++)
        yield i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>[...6]</code> returns <code>[0,1,2,3,4,5]</code>! Aren't generators fun?</p>
<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>const
</code></pre>
<p>This for a change is exactly what you've guessed! Its a new variable declaration syntax used for creating constant variables.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>const a = &quot;foo&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>a</code>'s value is fixed, any attempt to change it will lead to a <code>SyntaxError</code> (cos JS!). Not only that, if you skip the assignment part while declaring the variable, that will also lead to a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>const a;
// Exception: SyntaxError: missing = in const declaration

const a = &quot;foo&quot;;
a = &quot;bar&quot;;
// Exception: SyntaxError: invalid assignment to const a
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>...
</code></pre>
<p>Default arguments ? Java ? Nope! This is the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator" rel="noreferrer">spread operator</a> and it does exactly what it says.</p>
<p>For instance, you want to spread your array variable <code>A</code> into another array <code>B</code> in the middle alongside other things:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var B = [1, 2, 5, ...A, 8, 0];
</code></pre>
<p>That simple!</p>
<p>You can even do this with function calls or arguments.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function foo(a, b, ...c) {}
</code></pre>
<p>is a function whose first argument goes in <code>a</code>, second goes in <code>b</code> and rest all arguments (third, fourth ...) go in as an array in <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>Now if you want to call that function and all your arguments are in the array <code>A</code>, you can do it like</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>foo(...A);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Think that I put <em>greater than or equal to</em> sign the wrong way ? Think again! Think ES6!</p>
<p>This is one of the best features of ES6 - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions" rel="noreferrer">Fat arrow function</a> . Apart from reducing a lot of bytes while defining a function (<code>var a=_=&gt;_+_</code> instead of <code>var a = function(_){return _+_}</code>), arrow functions also change the behavior of <code>this</code> so that you don't have to <code>bind</code> the function again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>*
</code></pre>
<p>Multiplication ? Nope! Remember ES6! The <code>*</code> keywords is part of one of many syntax sugar + features of ES6 - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*" rel="noreferrer">Generators</a>. This is added to the <code>function</code> keyword to make the function a generator function.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>
<p>ES6 adds a lot of useful syntax sugar and features into the language inspired by a lot of other languages.</p>
<p>The most useful fact about ES6 is that due to the added syntax and features, it performs much better than ES5 (current generation JS across all browsers) in terms of <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a>.</p>
<p>The final spec for ES6 was finalized in June 2015, and all major browsers (except IE) have enabled most of the new features. You can check <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/" rel="noreferrer">this page</a> to see which features your browser supports, as well as all major browsers and other environments.</p>

<p>You contain the function code within the pipes and store the function in the variable <code>x</code> (can be any variable name). To run the code within the pipes, just write the function name.</p>

<p>(whoops I forgot the link before :p)</p>

<h2>(pair of) Factoid(s):</h2>

<p>Dotsplit is a mostly syntax free language, with odd builtins (kind of like mathematica), but is currently in it's infancy. Dotsplit is named after the tokeniser used in the interpreter: <code>str.split()</code>. This is a weak tokeniser, but it fulfills all needs of the language, so far anyway.</p>

<h2>1 byte:</h2>

<pre><code>D
</code></pre>

<p><code>D</code> does</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>nothing. it isn't a tiny builtin, unless you count a nop as a builtin, and it's only a nop because it isn't a defined command. Dotsplit has relatively long command names for most things. Note that the shortest happens to be three long. anything that isn't a defined command is ignored. also note commands are case insensitive, so if it were a command, <code>d</code> would be the same as <code>D</code></p>

<h2>2 bytes:</h2>

<p>still not much interesting</p>

<pre><code> b
</code></pre>

<p>b with a leading space. This program functions identically to <code>b</code>, as well as <code>D</code>, because nops, but if <code>b</code> was a command, <code>b</code> and <code>D</code> would not be the same, but <code>b</code> and <code>[space]b</code> would. Spaces are used to separate commands, but otherwise are ignored. Next upvote, and we get an actual command!</p>

<h2>3 bytes</h2>

<p>First command!</p>

<pre><code>aDd
</code></pre>

<p>This will pop a and b, and push a+b. Popping from an empty stack yields 0.
hence, this program will leave one 0 on the stack. <code>add</code> is case insensitive, and will function regardless of case (<code>AdD</code> will also work)</p>

<h2>4 bytes</h2>

<p>There are a fair amount more commands with 4 bytes, not many still. I chose this one</p>

<pre><code>derp
</code></pre>

<p>This program will wait for input by the user. If input is "derp" (case-sensitive), it prints "Derp". Otherwise, "Nope"</p>

<p>Created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in 1995, Ruby is a dynamical object-oriented programming language. It's built/inspired by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.</p>

<p>Matz, speaking on the Ruby-Talk mailing list, May 12th, 2000.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body</p>

In Ruby  everything is objects, so no primitives. Parentheses are also optional. Opening up for some interesting coding, but that doesn't mean that you have to avoid them.<br>
Is this really that readable?</p>

<p><code>puts array.delete hash.fetch :foo</code></p>

<p><strong>Snippet 1</strong><br>
Use the <code>$</code> to create global variables, but don't clutter the namespace please.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 2</strong><br>
To create a new hash, all you need to type is <code>{}</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 3</strong><br>
Ruby uses <code>nil</code> as a false value. So no need to do <code>var.nil?</code> everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 4</strong><br>
<code>puts</code> is used to print a string version of an object with a new line at the end. Short for "put string". Can also be shortened to just <code>p</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 5</strong><br>
To make Ruby even more powerful it handles closures. And with the use of <code>f.call</code> you can call/invoke a block or function. Pretty sweet. For those unfamiliar with closures. A closure can pass it around like an object (to be called later). It also remembers the values of all the variables that were in scope when the function was created. It can access those variables when it is called even though they may no longer be in scope.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 6</strong><br>
The snippet <code>class C</code> returns nil, and that is because everything in Ruby has a return value. You can even return multiple values.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 7</strong><br>
With the use of <code>include</code> Ruby support single inheritance. Making it easy to mixin modules.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 8</strong><br>
<code>x||=true</code> is one of several logical operators that Ruby supports. This one checks if x has been defined, and if not sets it to true.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 9</strong><br>
<code>Fo.new(x)</code> calls the class <code>Fo</code> initialize function, with the value of <code>x</code>. There is no constructor in Ruby so you are free to return what value you like from the <code>.new()</code> call.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 10</strong><br>
As mentioned earlier Ruby supports multiple return values, and it is easily done with <code>return x,y</code>. The values are returned as they are read, and if you have more return values then what you have for assigning the rest will be dropped. Using the <code>*</code> on the last variable will make an array and assign the rest of the return values to that array.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 11</strong><br>
RubyGems is the packet manager for Ruby started in November, 2003. Original a stand alone program, but as of Ruby 1.9 it is a part of the standard library.
Use the code snippet <code>gem install</code> and the name of the package (for example 'sinatra') to install it.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 12</strong><br>
<code>[1,2]&lt;&lt;[3,4]</code> The command '&lt;&lt;' pushes or append a object to the array. In our case the array [3,4] will be pushed 'into' the array [1,2], making it 'look' like this [1,2,[3,4]]. So it does not merge two arrays.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 13</strong><br>
<code>x.map{|y|y+1}</code> The map function iterates over the array 'x' and invokes the block given, and returning a new array with the modified values. In our case it will iterate over the values in the array and increment them with one.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 14</strong><br>
<code>x.map!{|y|y+1}</code> This snippet is similar to the previous one, but calls on the function map!. The '!'/exclamation mark tells the user that this function will modify the object calling it, often called destructive or dangerous functions.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 15</strong><br>
The snippet <code>ARGV[0] ||false</code> checks if <code>ARGV[0]</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, if not it will return the <code>or</code> value, false. <code>ARGV</code> is an array containing the arguments sent in at start time. <code>ruby app.rb test</code> will give you 'test' in <code>ARGV[0]</code>.</p>

<div id="pu100" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/dloscutoff/Esolangs/tree/master/Ouroboros" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ouroboros</a></h1>

<p>Each line of an Ouroboros program represents a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" rel="nofollow noreferrer">snake eating its own tail</a>, with the beginning of the line being the head and the end being the tail. The only control flow operations are commands to eat or regurgitate characters of the tail. When the instruction pointer reaches the last part of the line that hasn't been eaten, it loops back to the beginning. To stop execution, simply swallow the instruction pointer.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Ouroboros has a <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/61624/16766">Stack Snippet interpreter</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>n
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs the top of the stack as a number. An empty stack is treated as if it contained infinite zeros, so this outputs <code>0</code>. No characters are ever eaten, so the program loops (and prints) infinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>1(
</code></pre>

<p>Pushes a <code>1</code> and then uses <code>(</code> to eat that many characters from the end of the snake. This means eating the last character. However, since that's where the instruction pointer currently is, the snake dies and the program terminates.</p>

<p>The program would also terminate if the number were <code>2</code>, or indeed any larger number; in that case the entire snake would be swallowed. (Physically impossible, but hey--this is a metaphor.)</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>32n
</code></pre>

<p>Although Ouroboros processes one character per tick, it still supports multi-digit numbers in the expected way. This program will push and output <code>32</code> infinitely (rather than, for instance, pushing <code>3</code>, pushing <code>2</code>, and outputting only the <code>2</code>).</p>

<p>One interesting side effect: a multi-digit number is recognized as such even when it bridges the end of the snake. The code <code>2n3</code> will first output <code>2</code>, but thereafter will output <code>32</code> infinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>rnao
</code></pre>

<p><code>r</code> reads a positive integer from input, grabbing all contiguous digits until it finds a non-digit. <code>n</code> outputs as a number. <code>a</code> pushes <code>10</code>, and <code>o</code> outputs this as a character (newline). Thus, an input of <code>1 2.3 -4abc55</code> will yield</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
4
55
</code></pre>

<p>However, because this snippet doesn't terminate the loop when the input is used up, the program will continue: <code>r</code> will start giving <code>-1</code>s to signal end-of-input, and <code>n</code> will keep outputting them indefinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>n?2*(
</code></pre>

<p>Prints one or more <code>0</code>s, with the exact count depending on random numbers.</p>

<p><code>n</code> behaves as in snippet 1, outputting a <code>0</code> from the empty stack. <code>?2*</code> generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1 and doubles it. Then <code>(</code> eats that many characters (rounded down). Thus, if <code>?</code> generated a number >= 0.5, the program halts; if not, it loops, prints another <code>0</code>, etc.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>"oooo(
</code></pre>

<p><code>"</code> toggles between executing characters and treating them as a string. As in other 2D languages, you can define a string using only one quote mark because the instruction pointer wraps around. A key difference with Ouroboros, however, is that the string is pushed in reverse order, so that the first character is on the top of the stack. This means we don't need to write strings backwards or have a stack-reverse operator like >&lt;> does.</p>

<p>The above code pushes <code>"oooo("</code> and outputs the first four characters (the <code>o</code>s). It then uses the last number remaining on the stack (<code>40</code>, the charcode of <code>(</code>) as the argument to the <code>(</code> command. Eating 40 characters definitely swallows the IP, and the program halts.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>r.*.n!(
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62785/16766">Truth machine program.</a></p>

<p><code>r</code> reads a number from input, or -1 for EOF. <code>.*</code> multiplies it by itself, keeping 0 and 1 the same but mapping -1 to 1. <code>.n</code> dups and outputs the number. Finally, <code>!(</code> logically negates and  eats that many characters of the end of the snake. If the number was <code>0</code>, this eats the <code>(</code> and dies. If the number was <code>1</code>, this eats zero characters, and execution loops back to the beginning of the snake, printing <code>1</code> indefinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>i.0&lt;2*(o
</code></pre>

<p>Cat program.</p>

<p><code>i</code> reads a single character from input, pushing its charcode (or -1 on EOF). <code>.0&lt;</code> duplicates and tests if the value was less than 0; i.e., pushes 1 on EOF and 0 otherwise. <code>2*(</code> multiplies by 2 and swallows that many characters. On EOF, this eats <code>(o</code> and ends the program; otherwise, nothing is eaten, and <code>o</code> outputs the character from input. The snake then loops back to the beginning.</p>

<p>In writing this snippet, I realized that cat <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62379/16766">can actually be done in four characters</a>: <code>i.)o</code>. Go read the explanation on that answer for some crazy abuse of undefined behavior.</p>

<p><em>(Length 9 snippet pending)</em></p>

<h3>Length 10</h3>

<pre><code>.!+.@.nao+
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs the Fibonacci sequence, starting from 0 and continuing indefinitely.</p>

<p>First, we need to initialize the stack by pushing a <code>1</code>. The trouble is that any initialization code at the head of a snake will run <em>every</em> time through (since it's at the head, we have no way of eating it). Therefore <code>.!+</code> is designed to turn the top of the stack into a <code>1</code> iff it was previously <code>0</code> (which is the case when the stack is empty). <code>.!</code> dups and logically negates (<code>1</code> if the value was <code>0</code>, otherwise <code>0</code>), and <code>+</code> adds that result to the top value.</p>

<p>(For a version that uses a second snake to perform the initialization, see the GitHub readme.)</p>

<p>Now the bulk of the program. Call the two numbers on the stack <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, where <code>x</code> is smaller and <code>y</code> is on the top of the stack. <code>.@.n</code> copies <code>y</code>, rotates <code>x</code> to the top, and outputs a copy of it. <code>ao</code> outputs a newline (as in snippet 4), and <code>+</code> adds <code>x</code> to a copy of <code>y</code>. Now the stack contains <code>y</code> and <code>x+y</code>, and we proceed to the next iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu101" class="pu"><h1>Prolog</h1>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Prolog is one of the first and most popular logic programming language. </p>

<p>Since Prolog is a declarative language based on first-order logic, programs in it can be surprisingly elegant, or devilishly mindbending.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In Prolog programming (in contrast, perhaps, to life in general) our goal is to fail as quickly as possible.” — <em>The Art of Prolog</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>X
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, any identifier that starts with an uppercase letter is a <em>variable</em>, which initially has no value. Unlike most programming languages, variables in Prolog can only take a value <em>once</em> (we say that the variable gets <em>unified</em> with something). After unification, a variable cannot be updated (unless backtracking occurs… more on that later). Variables only get a type once they are unified (the type of what they get unified with), therefore a <em>free</em> variable can be unified with anything.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>X.
</code></pre>

<p>This is a valid query in Prolog. Unlike most languages, in prolog you run queries (like in SQL), and the Prolog execution engine will attempt to satisfy that query. In particular, it will unify variables along the way if those unifications make the query true. Each query ends with a period.</p>

<p>Here however, the query is not really meaningful, since we are asking Prolog to check that a free variable <code>X</code> is true, and it is for an infinite number of different unifications (any integer for instance would make this true). Therefore, here is what SWI-Prolog answers to that query:</p>

<pre><code>% ... 1,000,000 ............ 10,000,000 years later
% 
%       &gt;&gt; 42 &lt;&lt; (last release gives the question)
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>nl.
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, any identifier that starts with a lowercase letter is called an <em>atom</em>. They can be used to name predicates, facts, or simply as string-like objects. Here, <code>nl/0</code> is a predicate which has 0 arguments (hence the <code>/0</code> notation) and which is a built-in in Prolog. This predicate simply prints a line break to <code>STDOUT</code>:</p>

<pre><code>?- nl.

true.
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that Prolog really likes to print <code>true.</code> when it manages to satisfy your query (or <code>false.</code> when it doesn't).</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>X=0.
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, <code>=</code> is unification. Prolog will satisty this query by unifying <code>X</code> with <code>0</code>, which is the only possible way of satisfying it.</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>X=[].
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, the list is a central data structure that you will use constantly. All lists are written in square brackets. A special list that will show up very often (particularly when writing your recursion termination condition) is the empty list, noted <code>[]</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>X=3+B.
</code></pre>

<p>Prolog is homoiconic, and as such the above query is perfectly valid. The REPL returns the following:</p>

<pre><code>X = 3+B.
</code></pre>

<p>In short, we are unifying variable <code>X</code> with the expression <code>3+B</code> (which does not get evaluated in any way). If we now unify <code>B</code> with something, this will be reflected in <code>X</code>:</p>

<pre><code>?- X=3+B, B=5.
X = 3+5,
B = 5.
</code></pre>

<p>(As you can see, <code>X</code> is not evaluated to <code>8</code>)</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>X*X#=4
</code></pre>

<p>Here I am cheating slightly. To make the above work, you must first run the following query: <code>use_module(library(clpfd)).</code>. This is the constraint logic programming in finite domains (CLPFD) library, which allows us to do very powerful things: for instance, the REPL will return the following for the above query:</p>

<pre><code>X in -2\/2.
</code></pre>

<p><code>\/</code> represents the union of two domains. Therefore, what Prolog is telling use here is that for <code>X</code> to satisfy <code>X*X = 4</code> (the <code>#</code> in the query is CLPFD's syntax for constraints), <code>X</code> must be either -2 or 2.</p>

<p>This is a very powerful mechanism that allows to write constraints on variables, without specifying how to find the values that satisfy them. Writing something like a sudoku solver with this library is thus extremely easy: you only have to describe the constraints between cells, and the starting clues. Prolog will then find solutions for you!</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>X=2;X=9.
</code></pre>

<p>Prolog is a logic programming language, and as such you expect to be able to use disjunctions. This is exactly what <code>;</code> (<em>Or</em>) does: <code>X</code> unifies with <code>2</code> <em>OR</em> <code>X</code> unifies with <code>5</code>. When running this in Prolog's REPL, we get the following:</p>

<pre><code>?- X=3;X=9.
X = 3
</code></pre>

<p>The REPL halts after printing you this answer, instead of finishing and waiting for a new query. Indeed, Prolog thinks there are other possible answers (and there is one in this case), and so it is waiting to see if you are interested in those. By pressing <code>;</code>, it will give you another answer:</p>

<pre><code>?- X=3;X=9.
X = 3 ;
X = 9.
</code></pre>

<p>which is what we expected to get. Here, Prolog knows there are no other possible answers for what we queried, so it will finish and wait for another query.</p>

<p>The mechanism behind this is called <em>backtracking</em>: when Prolog choses to unify <code>X</code> with <code>2</code>, it remembers that it made that choice when in fact there are other possibilities (here, unifying <code>X</code> with <code>9</code>). When we ask for another answer (or if the query had failed after that choice), it will backtrack to the last choice it made and try another one, until no other choice is available.</p>

<h3>Length 9</h3>

<pre><code>a(ax+b).
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a fact, that constitutes your source code. We can make some interesting queries on that fact, to check out Prolog's pattern matching mechanism (remember that identifiers starting with an uppercase letter are free variables):</p>

<pre><code>?- a(X).
X = ax+b.
</code></pre>

<p>Cooler:</p>

<pre><code>?- a(X+b).
X = ax.
</code></pre>

<p>Even cooler:</p>

<pre><code>?- a(X+Y).
X = ax,
Y = b.
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 12</h3>

<pre><code>length(L,3).
</code></pre>

<p><code>length/2</code> is a built-in predicate of Prolog which is true if its first argument is a list of length its second argument. Here, we are setting the second argument as a ground integer, and the first as a variable. Thus, we get the following behavior:</p>

<pre><code>?- length(L,3).
L = [_G1500, _G1503, _G1506].
</code></pre>

<p>That is, for that query to be true, <code>L</code> must be a list of 3 elements; those elements are <code>_G1500</code>, <code>_G1503</code> and <code>_G1506</code> which are variables (those names are internal variable names).</p>

<p>We can also run that predicate with both arguments as variables, and get the following very powerful behavior:</p>

<pre><code>?- length(L,M).
L = [],
M = 0 ;
L = [_G1512],
M = 1 ;
L = [_G1512, _G1515],
M = 2 ;
L = [_G1512, _G1515, _G1518],
M = 3 ;
L = [_G1512, _G1515, _G1518, _G1521],
M = 4 ;

<div id="pu102" class="pu"><h1>QBasic</h1>

<p>The programming language that everybody grew up on<sup>[citation needed]</sup>--at least, everyone who grew up with MS-DOS during the 90s.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>QBasic is actually an interpreter and an IDE together.  When you enter code, the QBasic editor automatically formats it for things like whitespace and capitalization.  The <a href="http://qb64.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer">QB64 emulator</a>, which I'm using to test my programs, gives the option of turning auto-formatting off, allowing a few nice golfing shortcuts in an otherwise fairly verbose language.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>This is a valid QBasic program--but only because QBasic allows line numbers.  The above is therefore an empty statement (on line number 1), which does nothing.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>?a
</code></pre>

<p>Lots of stuff going on here:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>?</code> is a shortcut for <code>PRINT</code>.</li>
<li><code>a</code> is a variable. Since it doesn't have a type suffix and hasn't been declared with <code>DIM</code>, it is numeric; so it is auto-initialized to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Thus, this program is basically equivalent to <code>PRINT 0</code>. But because QBasic is optimized (?) for outputting numeric data in tables, what it actually prints is <code> 0 </code>. (The leading space is so <code>1</code> and <code>-1</code> will line up properly, and I suspect the trailing space is so that printing multiple numbers in a row won't result in something like <code>-1-2-3</code>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>CLS
</code></pre>

<p>QBasic doesn't use an output stream like C-based languages; instead, it uses a cursor to write stuff to a window (see snippet 13 for more on that). The DOS implementation doesn't clear the window between runs, so it can start to get cluttered after a while:</p>

<pre><code> 0 
 0 
 0 
</code></pre>

<p>--which is why most QBasic programs have the CLear Screen command somewhere near the beginning.</p>

<p>(The QB64 emulator starts over with a blank screen each time you run your program, which I find just a little disappointing.)</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>BEEP
</code></pre>

<p>Does <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/9004/play-a-sound-any-sound/11560#11560">just what you think it does</a>.</p>

<p>What I like about QBasic is that it has fun commands like this <em>built into the syntax</em>, whereas other languages usually require external libraries or weird workarounds. In Python, for example, the quickest way to get a beep is the extremely cryptic <code>print("\a")</code>; but that doesn't even work in all environments (in particular, the IDLE shell that comes with Python prints a bullet character instead).</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>?2^42
</code></pre>

<p><code>^</code> is exponentiation, of course. (Don't know what possessed C and its derivatives to use it for bitwise xor.)</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this looks like integer math, we don't get an overflow. The default numeric type in QBasic is actually <code>SINGLE</code>, which is a floating-point number that shows (up to) seven significant digits. If the fractional part is zero, it will display as an integer: for example, <code>PRINT 1.0</code> outputs <code>1</code>. The result above has more than seven significant digits, however; so we get it in scientific notation as <code>4.398047E+12</code>.</p>

<p>Annotating one of the operands with the <code>#</code> suffix would coerce the expression to <code>DOUBLE</code> precision, giving up to fifteen significant digits: <code>?2#^42</code> gives <code>4398046511104</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>?1:RUN
</code></pre>

<p>Our first multi-statement program! <code>:</code> is a statement separator.</p>

<p>The <code>RUN</code> command can be used in a few different ways. If you give it the name of another QBasic source file, it will switch execution to that program. If you give it a line number in the current program, it will restart the program at that line. (This is different from a <code>GOTO</code> because all variables are cleared, as if starting the program from scratch.) And if you don't specify an argument, it will restart the program from the top. The code above prints <code>1</code> infinitely.</p>

<p>If you don't want the <code>1</code>s on their own lines, you could use <code>?1;:RUN</code>--the semicolon suppresses the newline when printing. But that will actually give you <code> 1  1  1 ...</code> (see the length-2 snippet for why). To fill the screen with <code>1</code>s, you'd need to use a string: <code>?"1";:RUN</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>INPUT x
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>INPUT</code> statement by default displays a <code>?</code> prompt and waits for the user to enter a value. Lacking a type suffix, <code>x</code> is a single-precision numeric variable, so anything like <code>3.14</code> or <code>-42</code> is valid input. What happens if you try to enter something that's not a number?</p>

<pre><code>? Jabberwocky
Redo from start
?

<p>It's a bit cryptic, and it can royally mess up the alignment if your program is using some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">text-based user interface</a>, but at least the program doesn't <a href="http://ideone.com/KGsZTK" rel="nofollow noreferrer">crash</a>, <a href="http://ideone.com/2p9dRT" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interpret the input as 0</a>, or anything weird like that. ;^)</p>

<p><sub>Note: QB64 doesn't even let you type invalid characters when an INPUT statement asks for a number.</sub></p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>PLAY"CF"
</code></pre>

<p>Music is yet another feature awesomely built in to QBasic. This code plays two quarter notes (middle C and middle F). A <code>PLAY</code> string has ways of changing the octave, playing sharps and flats, changing the duration of notes, and so much more!</p>

<h3>Length 9</h3>

<pre><code>SCREEN 12
</code></pre>

<p>Different <code>SCREEN</code> modes in QBasic allow for different graphical capabilities: various resolutions, color vs. black-and-white, text-only or graphics-capable. Historically, these were included to account for differences among display hardware. The default mode, <code>SCREEN 0</code>, is text-only, so any program with graphics in it has to start with a <code>SCREEN</code> statement. (Pretty pictures later if I get more votes!)</p>

<h3>Length 10</h3>

<pre><code>?4*ATN(1#)
</code></pre>

<p>Would you care for some pi? QBasic has a good number of math functions built in, ArcTaNgent among them. The <code>#</code> type annotation is used here to make the resulting value <code>DOUBLE</code>, so we get more digits: <code>3.141592653589793</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 11</h3>

<pre><code>COLOR 2:?42
</code></pre>

<p>Time to get colorful.</p>

<p>In the default <code>SCREEN 0</code>, QBasic offers 16 foreground colors:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KcEPj.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KcEPj.png" alt="The 16 colors in QBasic"></a></p>

<p>Each color 8-15 is a lighter version of the corresponding 0-7 color. The darker colors 0-7 are also available as background colors, and adding 16 to a foreground color makes it blink! (See <a href="http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=33506" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this thread</a>, particularly the bottom post, for a great historical explanation.) So, since a <code>COLOR</code> statement affects everything subsequently printed, we can write this:</p>

<p><code>COLOR 25,4</code></p>

<p>and see this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V8G9J.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V8G9J.gif" alt="Blinking &quot;Press any key&quot;"></a></p>

<p>Trippy.</p>

<h3>Length 12</h3>

<pre><code>DRAW"F3U7R9"
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>DRAW</code> command takes a string of codes and draws stuff on the screen. As a graphics command, it cannot be used in the default screen mode, so you'll need to combine this snippet with snippet 9 in order to run it. This example goes 3 pixels diagonally down and right, 7 pixels up, and 9 pixels right, for a tiny square root symbol:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxAXR.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxAXR.png" alt="QBasic DRAW command--square root symbol"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<h3>Length 13</h3>

<pre><code>LOCATE 7,8:?9
</code></pre>

<p>Recall (from snippet 3) that QBasic outputs text to a window, not an output stream. The <code>LOCATE</code> command allows you to set the cursor location for output. So if you want to display something halfway down the screen, you don't need to print a bunch of newlines first--just <code>LOCATE</code> to the right row and column.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIZXO.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIZXO.png" alt="Using LOCATE command"></a></p>

<p>Importantly, this doesn't affect any other text on the screen (except when directly overwriting it), which makes QBasic very straightforward for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">textual user interfaces</a>--or <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/49082/16766">dungeon games</a>. Most languages would have to use control codes or a library like curses. </p>

<h3>Length 14</h3>

<pre><code>GOTO a
?1
a:?2
</code></pre>

<p>What would QBasic be without <code>GOTO</code>? The much-maligned feature is alive and well here, allowing arbitrary jumps in program flow to defined labels. The above snippet, of course, skips to the third line and outputs <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>A label must come at the beginning of a line. It can be any identifier followed by a colon; or, it can be a BASIC-style line number, sans colon.</p>

<p>While it is true that 1) most uses of <code>GOTO</code> can be replaced by conditionals or looping constructs and 2) those that are too complicated for this treatment are probably a bad idea to begin with, I still like <code>GOTO</code>, for a couple of reasons. First, it's how assembly works under the hood, so learning it first in QBasic is valuable practice. Second, I still think it's more readable (and less redundant) to write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>getNumber:
INPUT x
IF x = 0 THEN PRINT "Enter a nonzero number": GOTO getNumber
PRINT "The inverse is"; 1/x
</code></pre>

<p>than the Python equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>x = float(input())
while x == 0:
    print("Enter a nonzero number")
    x = float(input())
print("The inverse is", 1/x)
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 15</h3>

<pre><code>RANDOMIZE TIMER
</code></pre>

<p>QBasic does (pseudo)random numbers via the <code>RND</code> function, which is normally invoked without arguments and returns a random number in the range <code>[0, 1)</code>. However, you'll get the same sequence on each run of the program unless you seed the PRNG with the <code>RANDOMIZE</code> statement. The usual seed is <code>TIMER</code>, which returns the number of seconds since midnight. This provides a different seed on each run of the program... at least, if you don't run it at exactly the same time each day.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> want the same numbers each run (maybe for testing purposes), you can pass a constant to <code>RANDOMIZE</code>--or just put <code>RANDOMIZE</code> without specifying a seed, in which case you'll be prompted when you run your program:</p>

<pre><code>Random-number seed (-32768 to 32767)? 
</code></pre>

<p>Nobody can say QBasic isn't user-friendly.</p>

<h3>Length 16</h3>

<pre><code>CIRCLE(9,9),8,,2
</code></pre>

<p>Graphics command: combine with snippet 9 to run.</p>

<p>QBasic's drawing commands are interesting because they each have a unique syntax, tailored to make the most sense for the particular command. The syntax for <code>CIRCLE</code> is <code>CIRCLE (x, y), radius[, options]</code>. (If you think that's odd, just wait till we get to see <code>LINE</code> in snippet 18.)</p>

<p>The first option to <code>CIRCLE</code> is <code>color</code>: we could have drawn a green circle with <code>CIRCLE(9,9),8,2</code>. But we've got an extra character to play with, so let's leave the color option blank (defaulting to white) and look at the next option. This happens to be <code>startRadian</code>. A value of <code>2</code> means that instead of a full circle, we get an arc of 2π - 2 radians:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNZwb.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNZwb.png" alt="Arc of circle"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<p>(Note that this apparently follows the standard quadrants system, despite the fact that QBasic has the origin at the top left with the positive y-axis pointing down.) The remaining <code>CIRCLE</code> options are <code>endRadian</code> and <code>aspect</code>, which allows you to draw ellipses:</p>

<pre><code>CIRCLE(51,26),50,,,,0.5
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 17</h3>

<pre><code>LINE INPUT s$:?s$
</code></pre>

<p>Reads an arbitrary line of text from the user and echoes it back.</p>

<p>What's important here is the word "arbitrary." The reason for the existence of <code>LINE INPUT</code> is that the regular <code>INPUT</code> command can't read commas. It treats them as field separators, so you can get two strings in one go by doing <code>INPUT a$, b$</code>. (Also useful for reading comma-separated data from a file.) But what if your input contains commas? Well, you can wrap it in double quotes and it'll treat the comma as part of the string. But what if your input also contains double quotes? That's when you need <code>LINE INPUT</code>, which simply reads everything until you hit enter.</p>

<h3>Length 18</h3>

<pre><code>LINE(1,1)-(9,9),,B
</code></pre>

<p>Graphics command: combine with snippet 9 to run. Draws a line from <code>(1,1)</code> to <code>(9,9)</code>, right? Well... not exactly.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsQf7.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BsQf7.png" alt="It&#39;s a box!"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<p>This <em>would</em> create a diagonal line, except that we've also specified the <code>B</code> option for "box." So instead of a line, we get a rectangle. There's also <code>BF</code> for "box, filled." (As in snippet 16, the empty space between commas is for the unused color argument.)</p>

<p>I'm actually a fan of this unusual syntax, whenever it makes sense for the given command. I find that it's a mnemonic aid. Contrast the above with a function that takes a gajillion* positional arguments--you can never remember which one is which--or half a gajillion keyword arguments--you 1) have to remember the names of the keywords and 2) can end up with a pretty long line of code if you use multiple arguments. (I know the counterarguments; I'm just saying that this is something I enjoy about QBasic.)</p>

<p><sup>* Slight hyperbole.</sup></p>

<h3>Length 19</h3>

<pre><code>?0:PAINT(10,4),9,15
</code></pre>

<p>Graphics command: combine with snippet 9 to run.</p>

<p><code>PAINT</code> takes a starting point, a fill color, and a border color. It does a flood fill until it hits border-colored pixels or the edge of the screen. It's typically used to fill circles, rectangles, and other graphics figures. But hey, printed text is just pixels on the screen too:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zq6C9.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zq6C9.png" alt="0 donut filled with blue(berry) jelly"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<h3>Length 20</h3>

<pre><code>?ASC(INPUT$(1));
RUN
</code></pre>

<p><code>INPUT</code> and <code>LINE INPUT</code> aren't the only ways to get input in QBasic. The <code>INPUT$(n)</code> function reads <em>n</em> keypresses and returns them as a string. (It can also be used to read from a file or a serial port.) <code>INPUT$</code> does not display a prompt or echo the characters to the screen as they are typed. It therefore has a myriad of uses, from password entry to the famous "Press any key to continue."</p>

<p>The above program waits until the user presses a key, prints the ASCII code of that character, and loops infinitely using <code>RUN</code> (see snippet 6). Entering <code>ABC123&lt;esc&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;bksp&gt;</code> will result in output of</p>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Coffeescript is a language that compiles into Javascript. It's much less verbose than JS (and about the same as ES6), which makes it friendlier for <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a>ing.</p>

<p>This is the power sign, which is used like this: <code>a**b</code>. It replaces JS's <code>Math.pow(a,b)</code>, which saves 11 bytes.</p>
<h2>Length 3 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>(n)

<p><em>If you're having difficulty understanding any of these concepts (or, more likely, if I'm explaining them poorly), please feel free to try it yourself on <a href="http://tiny.cc/detour" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the online interpreter</a> which gives a nice visualization of the data moving around. There is also a <a href="http://detour.tryitonline.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TIO site</a> but it doesn't have a cell visualization tool</em></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Detour is a 2D language I made. While most 2D languages revolve around directing the instruction pointer (think <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish" rel="nofollow noreferrer">>&lt;></a>, <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge" rel="nofollow noreferrer">befunge</a>), this one focuses on redirection of <em>data/objects</em>. Each character in the program translates to a <em>cell</em>. Each cell will either simply pass on its contents (NOP), modify its contents and pass it on (operations such as addition), or redirect its contents (e.g. pointing its contents downward). More on this later.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Detour got its name from the "control flow" in the language. I often find myself constructing complex paths to make data travel around the existing data flow, hence "Detour". This is the purest form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">spaghetti code</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>:
</code></pre>

<p><code>:</code> specifies where input is taken. At the start of the program, all input arguments are pushed to the <code>:</code> cell, and then start moving rightward. If no <code>:</code> cell is found, one is inserted by default somewhere (usually at the top or middle).</p>

<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>+.
</code></pre>

<p>This is a program that adds two numbers and outputs the result. The <code>.</code> outputs its contents; that's pretty simple. The more complex part would be <code>+</code>. <code>+</code> is a binary operator which, as you would expect, adds two numbers. The way it adds them, however, is a little weird. In Detour, an operator that takes multiple operands will wait for all its operands to be in the cell before performing the operation. </p>

<p>So let's say a <code>3</code> is pushed into a <code>+</code> cell. That <code>3</code> will stay in that cell until a second number is also pushed into the cell. After our program does its thing, eventually a <code>4</code> finds its way into the same <code>+</code> cell. Now, it has two operands, and will happily add them together and push the result (<code>7</code>) into the next cell. </p>

<p>In this case, the next cell is <code>.</code>. Once the two input arguments get onto the <code>+</code> cell, their result is pushed to <code>.</code>, which outputs the result and exits the program.</p>

<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>$&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now it's starting to get interesting. <code>&lt;</code> is the decrement operator, so it takes <code>n</code> and pushes <code>n-1</code> to the next cell. <code>$</code> is the duplicate operator, it clones its contents, pushing one to the next cell, while the other skips the immediate cell. The first clone usually will then also hit the second cell.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>$&lt;&lt;
4

$&lt;&lt;
 44

$&lt;&lt;
  33

$&lt;&lt;
   23
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>$&lt;&lt;</code> yields <code>n-2, n-1</code>. I use this in my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/85/fibonacci-function-or-sequence/69796#69796">fibonacci sequence answer</a></p>

<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[&lt;,]
</code></pre>

<p>Now it starts to get interesting. <code>[]</code> denotes a loop; that is to say, data will pass through it until it is negative or zero. The body of the loop, <code>&lt;,</code> does two things: 1) decrement the number; 2) output it. For example, <code>4[&lt;,]</code> will output <code>3210</code></p>

<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[$&lt;&lt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Now we get to start combining previous snippets (I know, a bit cheaty, but it's late and I'm tired). Remember how in the length 3 snippet we discussed how <code>n$&lt;&lt;</code> yields <code>(n-2, n-1)</code>? Now imagine if we repeatedly run that process over all generated <code>n</code> until they are all ≤ 0? We get the fibonacci sequence! </p>

<p><em>Warning: the produced results  will be negative. Take this into account before <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/70652/reverse-engineer-the-n-bonacci-sequences#comment172902_70652">using this sequence for something that may pertain to black holes</a></em></p>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>g&gt;d$G+
</code></pre>

<p>This calculates, given <code>n</code>, <code>n + (n + 1) / 2</code>. While this is not very useful, it demonstrates an important concept: registers. <code>g</code> stores a value in the register, while <code>G</code> retrieves it. What happens is the number gets stored in <code>g</code>. Then it walks through, getting incremented (<code>&gt;</code>), cut in half (<code>d</code>), then duplicated (<code>$</code>). The new value (<code>(n+1)/2</code>) gets added to the value stored in <code>g</code> (<code>n</code>). This yields <code>n + (n+1)/2</code>. Here we start getting into the complicated stuff that's hard to explain with words, feel free to <a href="https://rawgit.com/cyoce/detour/master/interp.html?hex=Omc+ZCRHKy4K" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it in the interpreter</a>.</p>

<h2>Length 7 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;Q.
;d&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is again kind of nonsensical, but demonstrates two key components of Detour.</p>

<ol>
<li>Control flow (<code>Q</code>)</li>
<li>Recursion (<code>;</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>First off, Control Flow.
<br>
As mentioned in the intro, control flow in Detour is pretty nonstandard. In Detour, control flow cells manipulate an object's direction or location rather than its value. We have seen some control flow in the form of <code>$</code> and <code>[]</code>. 
<br>
As in the example, <code>Q</code> <em>conditionally</em> redirects objects: that is, it will move an object depending on the object's value. In <code>Q</code>'s case, it will push the object down (put keep it pointed in the same direction) if it is positive, and will push it forward otherwise.</p>

<p>Recursion (<code>;</code>) is another type of control flow. <code>;</code> will move an object to the start of the program (where the input came through, or more concisely, the location of the <code>:</code> cell). </p>

<p>Combining these two things, we can see what the snippet does</p>

<ul>
<li>take input <code>n</code></li>
<li>decrement it</li>
<li>If <code>n &gt;= 0</code>, push it down

<ul>
<li>halve it, then decrement it and move it back to the start (lines wrap around in Detour making <code>;&gt;d</code> equivalent to <code> &gt;d;</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Else, push it forward

<ul>
<li>output it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This can be translated to the following Python program:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def f(n):
  n -= 1      # &lt;
  if n &lt;= 0:  # Q
    print(n)    # .
  else:       # Q
    n /= 2      # d
    n -= 1      # &lt;
    f(n)        # ;

f(input())
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 9 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;Q&gt;S.
;$&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a recursive fibonacci definition. <code>S</code> sums up all items pushed to it. The bottom uses the fact that objects can wrap around the edges, so <code>;$&lt;</code> is identical to <code>$&lt;;</code> with a leading space.</p>

<h2>Factoid:</h2>

<p>Woefully is a 2d language with no traditional conditionals (ooh, that rhyme). The closest thing it has to conditionals is the boolean/not_zero command, which pushes <code>int(stack_A.pop()!=0)</code>. It's also pretty weird in other ways.</p>

<p>It isn't really possible to even write a program in less than 7 characters, unless you count printing the "error" message as a program, or immediately halting as a program, so perhaps I'll multiply the votes by 4 to get the amount of bytes I can have, if that's allowable (context: it takes 266 bytes to write a truth machine, unless it could be golfed more,)</p>

<h2>1*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>boom
</code></pre>

<p>this program technically doesn't error, but just prints "confuse :(", the "error" message of the language, which counts as regular output as it goes to STDOUT, not STDERR. This program doesn't conform to the program composition requirements (needs to have no characters that aren't pipes, spaces and newlines, needs to have at least one space, needs to have no spaces at the start and end of lines), and so automatically prints the message "confuse :("</p>

<p>BTW it is going to be a while before anything really interesting, like even a program that just takes input, or pushes a number, so you might want to look at my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/92377/55896">truth machine</a> to see what Woefully looks like</p>

<h2>2*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>| |
|| |
</code></pre>

<p>Ooh, we have the first program that doesn't just print "confuse :(" and die. This program does... nothing. It is in an infinite loop of nops</p>

<h3>Why it nops forever</h3>

<p>diagram!</p>

<pre><code>v
|\|
||\|
  X
</code></pre>

<p>The char pointer, the first of two pointers, starts at the character pointed to by v. The instruction pointer will find the first space after this char, and execute the path of spaces it is a part of. The <code>\</code> shows the path. the instruction pointer goes down this path, but does nothing, since lines that are two-long are nops. Once it finishes the path, (symbolised by the X), the instruction pointer returns to the char pointer, which has not moved, and executes it again, forever.</p>

<h2>3*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>| |
| |
| ||
</code></pre>

<p>This program terminates in an error (not confuse, but an actual error), but why?</p>

<p>three down executes the A to B command, popping the top of the A stack, and pushing it to the B stack. (there are two stacks). However, the program does not immediately fail, because the stacks start with values already on them: one zero each, it runs once normally, then fails the next iteration of the loop.</p>

<h2>4*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>||| |
|| ||
| ||
</code></pre>

<p>This program pushes zero to stack A infinitely. this is because all diagonally down left commands push the length of the command, minus three. minus three because a command that is two long is a nop, so the shortest push command is three long, and the smallest push-able value is zero.</p>

<h2>5*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>| || |
||| ||
|| |||
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't really have anything interesting (apart from some more erroring commands) to show this time, but I realised none of the snippets halt, though some error, so this snippet just halts, without doing anything (including the push at the right)</p>

<h3>diagram!</h3>

<pre><code>v       char pointer starts pointing here
|X||a|   X has the first space after that character, so it's path is executed
|||a|| X halts the program

<p>Tellurium is an esoteric, tape-based programming language written by me in Python. It's mainly intended for use in code-golf challenges, but it pretty much failed at that task.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>^

<p><code>^</code> is the output/print command. It outputs whatever is in the selected cell, which, in the above snippet, is 0. (0 is the default value)</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>i^
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simple cat program (a program that copies its input to its output). <code>i</code> takes input and puts it in the selected cell. As you probably remember, <code>^</code> outputs whatever is in the selected cell.</p>

<p>(I promise that there will be more interesting snippets later on. There's not much you can do with two commands)</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>I§^
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet calculates the factorial of the input and displays it.</p>

<p><code>I</code> gets input and converts it to an integer. <code>§</code> calculates the factorial, and stores the result in the selected cell.</p>

<p>There are numerous other math-related one character builtins, for example:</p>

<p><code>I½^</code> calculates the exponent of the input</p>

<p><code>Iq^</code> calculates the square root of the input</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>{p}f
</code></pre>

<p>This is an anonymous function that does... nothing.</p>

<p>In Tellurium, you can create an anonymous function by using the syntax <code>{code}f</code>. The function can then be called using the command <code>ä</code>.</p>

<p><code>p</code> is a placeholder command, the equivalent to the Python statement <code>pass</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>[I|^;
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet uses a loop to output <code>0</code> <em>n</em> times. The syntax for a loop in Tellurium is <code>[times|code;</code>. If <code>I</code> is in the <code>times</code> section, it will run the code <em>input</em> times.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>µHi!~^

<p>Finally, something more interesting. This snippet outputs <code>Hi!</code>. The syntax for inserting text into the selected cell is a bit strange: <code>µ(text)~</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>¤h|Hey]
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet showcases variables. Again, the syntax is a bit strange: <code>¤(name)|(value)]</code>. In this case, it stores "Hey" in the variable <code>h</code>.</p>

<p>To display that variable, use <code>;h.^</code>.</p>

<div id="pu115" class="pu"><h1>Clojure</h1>

<p>Clojure is a variant of Lisp which runs on the Java virtual machine and the .Net virtual machine. A cross-compiler is also available which will turn Clojure code into JavaScript, and thus Clojure code can be run on just about any computer. Clojure can be written in a functional style which is what got me interested in it.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 Snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>;</code> - comments begin with a semi-colon and run until the end-of-line. This is also a valid (if not particularly interesting :-) one-character program.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 Snippet</strong></p>

<p>One of the strengths of any Lisp-style language is its built-in support for collections. In Clojure there are three main collection types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lists, which are groups of values surrounded by parentheses - <code>()</code></li>
<li>Vectors, which are groups of values surrounded by square braces - <code>[]</code></li>
<li>Maps, which are pairs of values surrounded by curly braces - <code>{}</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Lists are both a data structure and the basis for all programming because all programs in Clojure consist of Lists of function names and arguments (Lisp was originally an acronym which stood for List Processor). An empty List (<code>()</code>), Vector (<code>[]</code>), or Map (<code>{}</code>) is also a valid (if uninteresting) program.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 Snippet</strong></p>

<p>Invoking a function in Clojure is done by putting the function name first in a list (also known as a sequence), followed by its arguments. For example, if we have a function named <code>a</code> then we would invoke it as <code>(a)</code>, assuming it takes no arguments.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 Snippet</strong></p>

<p>@user100464's comment got me thinking about quoted forms. A quoted form is introduced with a back-quote character, so</p>

<pre><code>`(a)
</code></pre>

<p>is a quoted form which will invoke the function <code>a</code> when the quoted form is executed. (This can also be written as <code>(quote (a))</code>). According to <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/colin-jones/2012/05/22/quoting-without-confusion.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this blog posting by Colin Jones</a>, quoting is "one of the most Lispy of the Lisp features". Colin's blog post goes into a good amount of detail about using quoting in Clojure macro definitions (which IMO is a topic worthy of entire books) - however, let's simply say that you can evaluate a quoted form using the (you guessed it) <code>eval</code> function. So let's say we create a simple function <code>a</code> with</p>

<pre><code>(defn a [] (println "a invoked"))
</code></pre>

<p>which we can invoke from the REPL with the "normal" unquoted form</p>

<pre><code>(a)
</code></pre>

<p>which prints</p>

<pre><code>a invoked
</code></pre>

<p>Cool. Now let's create a quoted form which will execute our function <code>a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(def quota `(a))
</code></pre>

<p>We can then invoke it with</p>

<pre><code>(eval quota)
</code></pre>

<p>which prints</p>

<pre><code>a invoked
</code></pre>

<p>So at its most basic level quoting allows us to create a form to invoke a function, then keep that form hanging around uninvoked until we want to invoke it. For those familiar with C a quoted form is a bit like a function pointer, allowing you to save up the ability to invoke a function anonymously until you're ready to do so. (Lispers - please don't start in on me. Yes, I know what I just said is hideously inaccurate and nearly-but-not-quite completely wrong. However, it's "lies to children" (ref. Terry Pratchett et al in his "Science of Discworld" series). If you think explaining nuclear physics to wizards is easy, <em>you</em> try it! :-) ((Rant on) And C'ers - please don't take offense. I wrote C et se derivees on a daily basis for over 10 years, Back In The Day. I don't anymore. Why? Simple - Moore's Law won. Due to CPU speed increases execution time has become a DRM issue - i.e. whether a compiled-and-optimized C program takes 0.0001 seconds to execute vs. an ugly, slow interpreted language version of the same program taking 0.1 seconds to execute Doesn't Really Matter - the user pushes Enter and the answer comes out before their finger lifts off the key. My day job is writing boring back-office code for a major retailer using Oracle's PL/SQL language (think "Ada with embedded SQL"). The byte-code interpreter is pretty good - but execution time is absolutely dominated by SQL execution time Every Single Time, so it's not that the PL/SQL byte-code interpreter is so great, it's that the CPU is sufficiently fast and the database is so much the elephant in the room that faster execution of non-database code Doesn't Really Matter.

<p>Ooooh! Tail recursion! Oooooh!</p>

<p>OK, now that we've gotten over that - WHAT THE HECK IS TAIL RECURSION?!?!? And I don't actually HAVE a tail - can I still use it?!?</p>

<p>Yes - yes, you can.</p>

<p>Tail recursion is a nice way of saying "Branching back to the start of the function (or some other point) instead of making a time-and-memory-consuming recursive function call". Recursive function calls do nasty things like consuming stack space, which is in limited supply and when it's gone, so's your program.</p>

<p>And oh-by-the-way, in Clojure you <em>have</em> to use tail recursion if you want to do any kind of looping. It's just kind of what you do.</p>

<p>Tail recursion in Clojure is done by using the <code>recur</code> form, which takes a variable number of values (see the Length 11 Snippet below for more information), binds those values to the bindings at the recursion point (say <em>what</em>?!?), and then jumps back to the recursion point. And oh-by-the-way - <code>(recur)</code> must be in tail position. (HUH?!?!?).</p>

<p>OK, let's explain.</p>

<p>First, what's a recursion point? A recursion point is a point in the program you can recurse back to. (Oh, thanks...). No, seriously - there are only two recursion points in Clojure - either the beginning of a function (in other words a <code>(defn...</code> or <code>(fn...</code> form) or the top of a loop (i.e. the <code>(loop...</code> form). </p>

<p>So, why all this agony to do looping? Why not something like <code>(for (= i 0) (&lt;= i 10) (+ i 1))</code>? Recall if you will that, in general, "variables" in Clojure DON'T CHANGE - in other words, variables are really constants. (Clojure cognoscenti: "lies to children", OK?). Thus, you don't (usually) assign a new value to a "variable", and thus you can't do the usual "loop" thing where you change the value of the loop control variable.</p>

<p>So what you do in Clojure is, you re-bind the function-or-loop parameters to new values, then re-run the function-or-loop against those new values. Hopefully, since you're doing recursion (and nobody likes an infinite recurser :-) you've got something in the body of your recursive code which forces the recursion to terminate. If not - well, then you can use your CPU to grill hot dogs... :-)</p>

<p>And, oh yeah - "tail position". <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7813497/clojure-what-exactly-is-tail-position-for-recur">There's a really good explanation of it here</a>, but suffice to say that an expression is in tail position if it would be returned from the form - i.e. it's not followed by any other form executions.</p>

<p>Now, in some Lisps tail recursion is performed by executing a form which calls the function the code is currently in. The compiler recognizes this and turns the call into a tail-recursive branch back to the beginning of the function if it can - so you'd see something like</p>

<pre><code>(defn some-func [n]
  (if (&lt; n 10)
    (do                       ; then case
      (printf "loop continues %d\n" n)
      (some-func (inc n)))
    (printf "loop done\n")))  ; else case
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>(some-func (inc n))</code> would be a tail-recursive invocation of <code>some-func</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that if the recursive form invocation isn't truly in tail position it will still be compiled properly by the compiler (it's valid code, after all) - but it will become a stack-consuming function call, which can cause your program to blow up unexpectedly, and it can be very difficult to figure out what's gone wrong.</p>

<p>Clojure's solution is to use the special <code>recur</code> form to indicate that a tail-recursive loop is desired. The compiler checks to ensure that the <code>recur</code> form is in tail position - i.e. that there are no form invocations which follow it in the loop - and then generates to code to re-bind arguments and branch back to the recursion point. In this manner you're guaranteed to get a truly tail-recursive branch or else you get a compiler error. Thus, in Clojure <code>some-func</code> would be:</p>

<pre><code>(defn some-func [n]
  (if (&lt; n 10)
    (do                       ; then case
      (printf "loop continues %d\n" n)
      (recur (inc n)))
    (printf "loop done\n")))  ; else case
</code></pre>

<p>For other examples of the use of <code>(recur)</code> look a bit further down the page to the Length 11 Snippet.</p>

<pre><code>(sum 1 2 3)
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things I like about Clojure is its handling of variable numbers of parameters to a function. Let's say that you want to write a function named <code>sum</code> to sum up a bunch of numbers (which is a completely <em>stupid</em> thing to do in Clojure, as it already has a very nice function called <code>+</code> which does exactly that - so <code>(+ 1 2)</code> returns 3, <code>(+ 1 2 3 4)</code> returns 10, and so on - but we'll do it anyways, not because we're stupid, but because we're writing a snippet to explain a concept :-). Well, golly, you say, if I want to enter <code>(sum 1 2)</code>, that's a function which takes two arguments; but if I want to add up three arguments that would be <code>(sum 1 2 3)</code>, which would be a different function; and then <code>(sum 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 987654321)</code> would be Yet Another Function, etc, ad nauseum. It sure would be nice if there was a way to let a function just take in all the arguments someone wanted to pass, without having to explicitly name them every time. And, of course, there is... :-)</p>

<p>In Clojure you specify a function which takes a variable number of parameters thusly:</p>

<pre><code>(defn a-func [arg1 arg2 &amp; more-args] ... )
</code></pre>

<p>This function requires two arguments <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code>, and accepts an undefined number of additional arguments which are put into a vector and bound to the argument <code>more-args</code>. So let's see how we'd take advantage of this to write a <code>sum</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>(defn sum [n &amp; more-n]
  (loop [ tot     0
          num     n
          rest-n  more-n ]
  (if (&gt; (count rest-n) 0)
    (recur (+ tot num) (first rest-n) (rest rest-n))
    (+ tot num))))
</code></pre>

<p>Here we define a function <code>sum</code> which takes <em>at least</em> one argument, named <code>n</code>, and optionally takes a bunch of other arguments which will be lumped together into <code>more-n</code>. Inside the function we create a loop (which is, if you recall, a recursion point) which defines several bindings: <code>tot</code> is the summed total of all the arguments, which will be returned later; 'num', which is the number we're working with right now; and <code>rest-n</code> which is the rest of our numbers.</p>

<p>Note that a slightly more Lisp-y way to define our <code>sum</code> function is to use a "worker" function to do all the actual summation work instead of a loop:</p>

<pre><code>(defn sum-all [tot n more-n]
  (if (&gt; (count more-n) 0)
    (recur (+ tot n) (first more-n) (rest more-n))
    (+ tot n)))

(defn sum [n &amp; more-n]
  (sum-all 0 n more-n))
</code></pre>

<p>This version turns the <code>loop</code> of the first version into a separate function, which then recursively re-invokes itself.</p>

<p>So now you know a bit about handling variable numbers of arguments in Clojure.</p>

<div id="pu116" class="pu"><h1>dc</h1>

<p>Almost nine months later -- I can't believe <strong>dc</strong> is not on the list!</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>dc (<strong>d</strong>esktop <strong>c</strong>alculator) is a Unix utility older than the C programming language, and also the hardest programming language to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">google</a>. Luckily it's probably preinstalled on your Linux, Unix or Mac box, and available for Cygwin too!</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>dc is a stack oriented language. <code>1</code> is an instruction that pushes the number 1 one the stack so that we can use it for other instructions.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>?f
</code></pre>

<p>These <em>two</em> characters is a whole dc program that actually does <em>three</em> things! It takes a line of input, evaluates the input as dc code, and prints the contents of the stack afterwards. You can feed it with the next snippet that I will post if I get another vote :)</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>zzp
</code></pre>

<p><code>z</code> pushes the current stack depth. Initially the stack is empty, so <code>0</code> is pushed on the stack. The stack is then 1 deep, so the next <code>z</code> pushes <code>1</code>. <code>p</code> prints the top of the stack, which at this point is <code>1</code> (although the stack depth is now 2 :D). </p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>1A0F
</code></pre>

<p>dc supports number input to be in any base from 2 to 16, so the characters <code>0123456789ABCDEF</code> all work as digits. Input numbers are <em>not</em> limited to only digits found in the current radix, but they still respect the positions of that base. This means that in base 10 (which is the default), the given snippet evaluates to
 <code>1*10^3 + A*10^2 + 0*10^1 + F*10^0</code> = <code>2015</code> :)</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>O[P]x
</code></pre>

<p>A convoluted way of printing a newline! <code>O</code> pushes the current <em>output</em> radix (which defaults to 10 and is independent of the input radix). <code>[]</code> defines a <em>macro</em> and pushes it. <code>x</code> pops the macro and executes it. <code>P</code> pops and prints a value as a byte stream.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>[dx]dx
</code></pre>

<p>Duplicate and execute, duplicate and execute, rinse and repeat. One copy of the macro is always left on the stack, so this loops forever. On some systems or implementations it may crash.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>[]sf7&gt;f
</code></pre>

<p>This is sort of an if-statement: It will execute the empty <code>[</code>macro<code>]</code>, which is first <code>s</code>tored in register <code>f</code>, if the top of the stack is <em>less</em> than 7. Intuitive, huh? Just wait for an if-else! I will need way more characters for that though ;)</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>3812649P
</code></pre>

<p>Prints a smiling face <code>:-)</code> Another example of the <code>P</code> command. 3812649 is the character points of the smiley string shifted to their correct position in base 256 and added together. Very useful technique for creating quines and quine-like programs.</p>

<h3>Length 9</h3>

<pre><code>[9&lt;L]dsLx
</code></pre>

<p>This is kinda the standard template for a loop -- <code>9</code> can be replaced with any code, and you can use other comparisons than <code>&lt;</code>. As the snippet stands now though, it is perhaps not the most useful thing in the world:</p>

<p>The comparison consumes one element in addition to the 9 that is pushed every time, so the snippet will pop each element down to, and including, the first element which is less than or equal to 9. If it were to empty the stack, the last comparison would fail with a warning, and leave the 9 on the stack.</p>

<h3>Length 10</h3>

<pre><code>6581840dnP
</code></pre>

<p>If I had actually counted how few characters it takes beforehand, I guess I wouldn't have ruined the surprise just two snippets ago, but yeah... this is a quine.<br>
<sub><sup>(That means that the program prints out its own source code)</sup></sub></p>

<h3>Length 11</h3>

<p>I just came up with this for the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/84327/4372">dc golfing tips</a> post, and I'm quite excited because I'm absolutely sure that this is the shortest possible way to write an <strong>if-else-statement</strong>!</p>

<p>Suppose you want to do <em>if top-of-stack == <code>(THAT)</code> then <code>(THEN)</code> else <code>(ELSE)</code></em> </p>

<pre><code>[[(THEN)2Q]sI(THAT)=I(ELSE)]x
</code></pre>

<p>Uses the <code>I</code> register. The placeholders <em>(THAT)</em>, <em>(THEN)</em> and <em>(ELSE)</em> isn't part of the byte count, and <code>=</code> can of course be exchanged with any of  <code>&gt;</code>, <code>!&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>!&lt;</code>, <code>!=</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 3 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>"a"

<p>This pushes the string <code>"a"</code> to the stack. Pretty self-explanatory. Note that single quotes <code>'</code> cannot be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>tran</code> is an incredibly useful built-in I just implemented. This operator is used to define a stack <code>tran</code>sformation. It takes two arrays describing the old and new state of the stack. The second array should be a shuffled version of the first, and the stack will be modified accordingly.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
:: [1, 2, 3, 4]

&gt;&gt;&gt; [.a, .b] [.b, .a] tran

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>10 =x

<p>This is the syntax for setting variable <code>x</code>. Note that the <code>=</code> sign has to be <em>touching</em> the identifier; <code>10 = x</code> would do something different.</p>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&amp;print
</code></pre>

<p>Now we get into the interesting stuff. <code>print</code> is a function that pops something from the stack and outputs it. <code>&amp;</code> is a prefix that makes its function peek from the stack instead of popping it. This means that the top of the stack will be outputted, but still left on the stack.</p>

<h2>Length 7 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>{10} if
</code></pre>

<p>This showcases two things - blocks and if-statements. A block holds a piece of code. The block <code>{10}</code> is a block that pushes <code>10</code> to the stack. The <code>if</code> command pops a value from the stack, and if it is truthy, executes the given block. In this case, it would push <code>10</code> to the stack.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
:: [0]

&gt;&gt;&gt; {10} if

</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<h1>Length 8 Snippet</h1>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>{3 2 ^-}
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates another modifier, related to <code>&amp;</code>. Without the <code>^</code>, the block <code>{3 2 -}</code> would just push the difference of 3 and 2 (1). However, the <code>^</code> in front of <code>-</code> makes it do something special. If the block is called with an <code>&amp;</code>, it will execute <code>&amp;-</code> (peek for operands); if not, it will execute <code>-</code> (pop the operands).</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {3 2 ^-} =f

<p>OK, let me explain a little about PyCal. PyCal has two "variables". One variable's value can be set by the user. The other variable's value comes from the values that some commands return. For example, the <code>F</code> returns the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number.</p>

<p>Anyways, the <code>!</code> command outputs the value that is in the user-set variable. By default, it's 0, so the above snippet outputs 0.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>IP

<p>This snippet outputs the first <em>n</em> prime numbers as a list.</p>

<p><code>P</code> takes the variable's value and prints <em>n</em> prime numbers. For example, if the value is 5, it will output the first 5 primes.</p>

<p>So, here's what it will look like if the input is 10:</p>

<pre><code>????????????????
</code></pre>

<p>Like the length 10 snippet originally was, this snippet is hidden until somebody finds the easter egg.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/Mego/Seriously/commit/ae71a1bb9a3663713ae479421f1595f246ba02b6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this commit</a>, I introduced an easter egg. If you input the correct 16-byte code as an Actually program, something special will happen!</p>

<p><strong>Length 15 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3,4,5];♀ⁿσ
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://actually.tryitonline.net/#code=WzEsMiwzLDQsNV074pmA4oG_z4M&amp;input=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>

<p>This snippet showcases two new features of Actually:</p>

<ul>
<li>The binary map operator <code>♀</code>: it works like <code>♂</code>, but maps a binary function over the top two stack elements, instead of mapping a unary function over the top element.</li>
<li>The cumulative sum function <code>σ</code>: it takes a list as input, and outputs a list where each element is the sum of the first <code>n</code> elements of the input list.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program outputs the cumulative sums of <code>[x**x for x in [1,2,3,4,5]]</code>. The equivalent Python code would be <code>[1**1,1**1+2**2,1**1+2**2+3**3,1**1+2**2+3**3+4**4,1**1+2**2+3**3+4**4+5**5]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 14 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>1WX╚;;S=YWX♂.X
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet sorts the input list using bogosort and prints out each value in ascending order, separated by newlines.</p>

<p>Cool things in this snippet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implicit input: because there are no input commands (<code>,</code>, <code>○</code>, <code>♀</code>, or <code>╩</code>) in the code, Actually reads all input, parses it, and pushes it before beginning evaluation of the code.</li>
<li>The <code>♂</code> command: it's a shortcut for the map (<code>M</code>) command. It takes the next command (<code>.</code> in the above snippet) and maps it over the list on top of the stack. <code>♂.</code> is functionally equivalent to the following (and 2 bytes shorter!):</li>
</ul>

<pre>`.`M</pre>

<p><strong>Length 13 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>:12345678;;+▼
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet shows off a lot of new things. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>:12345678</code>: improved numeric parsing. Rather than needing to be wrapped in <code>:</code>s, numerics merely need to be prefixed with one, and are parsed as the longest string following the <code>:</code> consisting only of characters in <code>0123456789+-.ij</code>.</li>
<li><code>▼</code>: new function (gcd reduce). In this form, it pops two integer values off the top of the stack, and pushes them divided by their gcd.</li>
<li><code>▼</code>: dingbats for characters <code>0x01 - 0x1F</code>. No more typing those pesky invisible or formatting-ruining ASCII control codes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Length 12 snippet</strong></p>

</code></pre>

<p>Now that <a href="https://github.com/Mego/Seriously/releases/tag/v2.0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Seriously v2.0 (codename Actually)</a> has been released, it's time to start showing off some nifty features I've added. This snippet shows off nested lists - something that Seriously was lacking because I didn't take the time to write a good parser when I created it. This pushes <code>[[1, 2], [3, 4]]</code> to the stack.</p>

<p>But wait, it's missing the ending bracket! <em>Actually</em>, it isn't. It's implied at EOF. However, the inner list(s) still need their ending brackets, even if the ending brackets are at the end of the source code. This may be changed soon.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11 snippet</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note: this is defunct as of now, due to the Heroku site being disabled. No worries though, a similar easter egg will be added into the actual Python interpreter soon.</strong></p>

<pre><code>↑↑↓↓←→←→ba

<p>A newline at the end makes this 11. This is the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Konami code</a> - "up up down down left right left right b a" (pressing enter to confirm the code, like start in Contra). Entering this in the <a href="https://seriouslylang.herokuapp.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter</a>, using the arrow keys for the directional inputs, will result in a fun little easter egg - the second easter egg I added.</p>

<p><strong>Length 10 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>??????????
</code></pre>

<p>I added two easter eggs to the Seriously interpreter recently. The first one (from <a href="https://github.com/Mego/Seriously/commit/fb4170c5023975520b346103dec7f10b79070f8d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this commit</a>) involves doing something special when your code starts with a certain 10 characters. <s>However, I don't want to spoil the secret, so until somebody figures it out, the above code will just be 10 question marks (which is <em>not</em> the secret).</s></p>

<p>Since I've <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/31129955#31129955">revealed the original secret</a> in chat, I might as well reveal it here too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In v1, back before I removed the easter egg, if your code started with <code>^^vv&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;ba</code>, the rest of the code would get <code>exec</code>'d (run as Python code).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>?</code> character will eventually be used as a prefix for some two-byte commands, once the single-byte command table fills up. In addition, once I get it working, <code>??</code> will be a comment delimiter.</p>

<p><em>Update: This secret was causing the interpreter to misbehave, so it has been removed for now. It will come back later, once I can make sure it doesn't break things again.</em></p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>,▓r`P`M
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet prints a list of the primes that are less than or equal to the input value.</p>

<pre><code> ,    push input (indented one extra space here so that the below character doesn't hide it)
▓    pop a: push pi(a) (# of primes less than or equal to a)
r    pop a: push range(0, a) ([0,...,a-1])
`P`  define a function that executes P (pop a: push the ath zero-indexed prime)
M    pop a function f and a list l, apply f to each element of l
</code></pre>

<p>Seriously is <em>seriously</em> powerful and terse when it comes to math. I refuse to apologize for the terrible pun.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>╦ï*╠^φ</code></p>

<p>This snippet showcases the mathematical constant builtins:</p>

<p><code>╦</code> pushes <code>π</code>.</p>

<p><code>ï</code> pushes <code>i</code>, the imaginary unit.</p>

<p><code>*</code> multiplies the top two values.</p>

<p><code>╠</code> pushes <code>e</code>.</p>

<p><code>^</code> pops <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and pushes <code>pow(a,b)</code>.</p>

<p><code>φ</code> pushes <code>φ</code>, the golden ratio.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>1.61803398875
(-1+1.22464679915e-16j)
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet demonstrates Euler's Identity, one of the most important identities in complex analysis: <code>e^(i*π) = -1</code>. The output value isn't quite <code>-1</code> due to floating-point precision issues and rounding errors, but it's very close. It also outputs <code>φ</code> because I needed a 6th character and I wanted to show off all of the math constants.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>:1+2j</code></p>

<p>Complex number support! I worked a long time on getting this functioning, because Python 2 (the language Seriously is implemented in) does annoying things involving complex numbers.</p>

<p><code>:</code> is the numeric delimiter - everything between it and the next <code>:</code> (or, in this case, EOF - hooray, more implied delimiters) is interpreted as a numeric value and pushed. If it can't be interpreted as a numeric value, <code>0</code> is pushed instead, following the tenet of No Errors.</p>

<p><code>asdf</code></p>

<p><code>a</code>: invert the stack</p>

<p><code>s</code>: pop <code>a</code>: push <code>sgn(a)</code></p>

<p><code>d</code>: pop <code>[a]</code>: dequeue a value <code>b</code> from <code>[a]</code>, push <code>[a],b</code></p>

<p><code>f</code>: pop <code>a</code>: push the index of <code>a</code> in the Fibonacci sequence, or <code>-1</code> if <code>a</code> is not a Fibonacci number.</p>

<p>Pretty simple, right? Wait... There's nothing on the stack! How is this program supposed to work?</p>

<p>In Seriously, one of the fundamental design tenets was that there are no errors. If a command does not get an appropriate value from the stack, it does not throw an error. Instead, it restores the stack and quietly exits. All of these commands are NOPs when the stack is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>,,+</code></p>

<p>This reads in 2 values and adds them (for whatever adding means for the two values). If you pass in two ints, like <code>5</code> and <code>3</code>, the result will be <code>8</code>. If you input two strings like <code>"foo"</code> and <code>"bar"</code>, they are concatenated to form <code>"barfoo"</code> (reversed because they are appended in the order they appear on the stack). If you input two lists, the result will be appending the second to the first: <code>[1,2,3][3,4,5]+ -&gt; [3,4,5,1,2,3]</code>. Adding functions results in their code being appended. Whatever the result, it will be printed to STDOUT.</p>

<p>...wait, why is it printed to STDOUT? There's no <code>.</code> in that snippet! Or is there? When a Seriously program terminates, each value on the stack is popped and printed - there's no need for an explicit <code>.</code> or <code>ü</code> at the end of a program. This is just another feature that saves those ever-precious bytes.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>1W</code></p>

<p>This is an infinite loop. <code>1</code> pushes the integer 1 onto the stack, and <code>W</code> is a loop delimiter - the code inside the loop (which is nothing) executes while the value on top of the stack (which is peeked, not popped) is a truthy value (not <code>0</code>, <code>''</code>, <code>[]</code>, or an empty function). This snippet shows off one of my favorite features in Seriously: like TI-BASIC, closing delimiters are not needed at the end of programs; they are implicitly present at EOF.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>H</code></p>

<p>This prints <code>Hello, World!</code> to STDOUT if the stack is empty.</p>

</div>
<div id="pu123" class="pu"><h1>Tcl</h1>

<p>See also <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44777/25180">this answer</a>.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>In Tcl eval is not evil in most cases. And you can implement your own control structures using eval.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>h
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>tclsh</code> interactively, you need only to write the initial characters of a command, if it is not ambiguous. In this case, there is only one command <code>history</code> beginning with <code>h</code>. So it will print the command history, which is like this:</p>

<pre><code>     1  h
</code></pre>

<p>If you try <code>a</code> instead, it will print something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ambiguous command name "a": after append apply array auto_execok auto_import auto_load auto_load_index auto_qualify
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>

<p>It's the empty string, just like <code>""</code> and <code>{}</code>, but works differently. It executes the commands in the brackets, which are nothing, and substitute the result of the last command, which is empty.</p>

<p>The empty string is also a prefix of every command. So if you type <code>[]</code> directly in <code>tclsh</code>, you can get a list of all available commands while it complains that the empty string is ambiguous.</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>end
</code></pre>

<p>Used in <code>lindex</code>, <code>lrange</code>, <code>string index</code>, <code>string range</code>, etc. While most languages require an extra operation to get the length of a string/list to specify a position at the end of the string, Tcl simply uses <code>end</code>. You can also use <code>end-k</code> where k is an integer, to make it more useful.</p>
