<p>Picat is a language somewhat like Prolog but with constraint solving capabilities built-in.</p>
<p>The main predicate is <code>g(V,E)</code>, where <code>V</code> is a list of vertex IDs and <code>E</code> is a list of pairs of vertex IDs. <code>g(V,E)</code> succeeds when the graph represented by <code>V</code> and <code>E</code> is a cactus, and fails otherwise.</p>
<p>The SAT solver provides many global constraint built-ins for graphs. <code>hcp(V,E)</code> specifies that a subset of vertices <code>V</code> and edges <code>E</code> forms a Hamiltonian cycle. The input lists look like <code>V = [{1, V1}, {2, V2}, {3, V3}]</code> and <code>E = [{1, 2, E1}, {2, 3, E2}, {3, 1, E3}]</code>, where <code>Vi</code> and <code>Ei</code> are boolean variables. The edges are considered directed in <code>hcp</code>.</p>
<p>In this code, <code>hcp</code> is abused to find the number of simple cycles in the given graph. With reverse edges and the <code>number of edges &gt;= 3</code> constraint, the number of solutions is precisely twice the number of cycles.</p>
<p>Cactus graphs have a property about <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircuitRank.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">circuit rank</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Circuit rank <span class="math-container">\$\mu\$</span> is defined to be <span class="math-container">\$\mu = e - v + c\$</span>, where <span class="math-container">\$c\$</span> is the number of connected components.</p>
<p>The relationship with the number of undirected cycles <span class="math-container">\$\nu\$</span> is given as <span class="math-container">\$\mu \le \nu \le 2^\mu - 1\$</span>. <strong>For connected graphs, <span class="math-container">\$\mu = \nu\$</span> holds for (and only for) cactus graphs.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the graph is connected, <span class="math-container">\$\mu = e - v + 1\$</span>. Let <span class="math-container">\$t = \nu - e + 2v - 1\$</span>. Then, since <span class="math-container">\$\mu \le \nu\$</span>, <span class="math-container">\$t = \nu - e + 2v - 1 \ge v\$</span>. If we find a tree that is a subgraph of <code>(V, E)</code> and contains <span class="math-container">\$t\$</span> vertices, we can conclude that <span class="math-container">\$t = v\$</span>, the graph is connected (since a spanning graph exists), and the graph is a cactus (since <span class="math-container">\$\mu = \nu\$</span>). Otherwise, the graph is not a cactus since either <span class="math-container">\$t &gt; v\$</span> (too many cycles) or a spanning tree does not exist (not connected).</p>

<p><a href="http://retina.inf.ufsc.br/picat_guide/#x1-650003.7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Picat guide</a> has a <code>maxflow</code> predicate defined using CP. This got me to come up with this alternative solution.</p>
<p>For every possible pair of vertices A and B, compute the maximum flow on the unit capacity network with source A and sink B. If the maximum flow is zero, A and B are disconnected. If the maximum flow is 3 or higher, there are at least 3 edge-disjoint paths from A to B, which means that A and B are the two endpoints of an intersection of two simple cycles. Both statements also hold backwards, so if all flows are either 1 or 2, we can conclude that the graph is a cactus.</p>

<h2>Theory</h2>
<p>A simple cycle can be thought of as two disjoint simple paths between a pair of vertices. Similarly, our conjoined cycles correspond to three distinct simple paths being present between a pair of vertices (better explanation near the bottom of the ungolfed code).</p>
<p>To detect these conjoined cycles, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>find all paths between all pairs of vertices, keeping track of the edges using Python sets.</li>
<li>for each pair of vertices, if three paths are pairwise disjoint, then a conjoined cycle is present.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first bullet has the side-benefit of making the connectedness easy to test: if a path exists between every pair of distinct vertices, then the graph is connected.</p>
<h2>Potential improvements</h2>
<p>If input could be taken via STDIN as <code>n</code> followed by <code>n*n</code> rows of boolean values, 13 bytes could be saved, but it doesn't feel right.</p>
<p>A lot of generator for-loop code is repeated, so surely there's a better way. I tried <code>itertools.product</code>, but that ended up with a net cost of +9 bytes. I might have to go with exec/string-replacement abuse like in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/206476/68261">Baba</a>, which could especially help with <code>for i in Q</code> being used four times.</p>
<h2>Ungolfed Code</h2>
