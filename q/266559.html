<div id="pu0" class="pu"><p>If &quot;better&quot; means better code in terms of readability and maintainability, you can use a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex</a> like <code>(...)(...)(.+)</code> and to replace it with <code>($1) $2-$3</code>.</p>
<p>This has the benefit that you can immediately tell that the pattern is going to take the first three characters as one group, the second three characters as the second group, and the rest as the third group. There's also less clutter in the &quot;replace with&quot; pattern which makes it pretty readable as well.</p>
<p>Finally, should you need to adjust the pattern, you can add or remove dots in any of the groups individually. Say that you discover that while the phone numbers are all US numbers but actually have a <code>+1</code> country code prefix, and you need to extract that as part of the are code, you would only need to add two dots in the first group, like this:</p>
<p><code>(.....)(...)(.+)</code></p>
<p>The &quot;replace with&quot; pattern would not need changes.</p>
<p>That would be much less prone to mistakes than editing the numbers in the <code>f&quot;()</code> in the question.</p>
<p>This is admittedly a contrived example. Any real phone number formatter would have to include many checks and additional criteria, using <code>\d</code> instead <code>.</code> and so on.</p>
